<p>The difficulties of making electric measurement on living matter were known since the beginnings: 'Since it is quite generally believed that the depolarization of a nerve fiber membrane, during excitation and propagation, involves an increased permeability to ions there have been many attempts to detect and to measure this change as an increase in the electrical conductivity. ... In these cases the measuring current was also the stimulating current and it was not possible to analyze the changes satisfactorily.' <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_COLE_CURTIS_IMPEDANCE:1939">[15]</a> We discuss below some fine differences compared to measuring in metals. It is frequently forgotten that the mentioned processes 'produce' electric charge in the measured system. Somehow, researchers forgot this warning and attibuted the created charge to some changed conductivity. We attempt to interpret the notions precisely below.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="MEASURING_CONDUCTANCE"></a>
Conductance</h1>
<p>When measuring electric resistance (or conductance), we need:</p><ul>
<li>Charged objects that can be moved, the charge carriers</li>
<li>An electric field that moves the charge carriers</li>
<li>No other field (such as concentration gradient) moves the charge carriers</li>
<li>A medium that 'resists' moving the charge carriers</li>
</ul>
<p>Charge is the primary abstraction in connection with electrical terms. Charge generates a potential field, and its movement generates current (furthermore, electromagnetic waves). When those secondary entities interact with some macroscopic material, their relation to that material defines some feature, such as dielectricity or resistance. <em>Those ternary entities manifest (i.e., are measurable) only when charge is present.</em> Experience shows that, <em>in the presence of electric potential,</em> different media show different resistance against <em>transferring charges</em>, so we define resistance/conductance <em> as one of the media's macroscopic features</em> (which is connected to microscopic features by Stokes's Law, see Equ. \(\eqref{eq:StokesCurrent}\)).</p>
<p>To measure conductance, we must generate charge: we must apply some voltage to the medium and measure the current with which the medium responds. The fact is known in neurophysiology (but either forgotten or not understood), see <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_JohstonWuNeurophysiology:1995">[31]</a>, section A.3.12: "<em>(input impedance) can be measured by applying a voltage and measuring the resulting current or by injecting a current and measuring the resulting voltage</em>". We often forget that we concluded the notion for metals and that if the number of moved charge carriers changes during the measurement, or a "foreign" (not considered) force field also affects the object, our measurement will produce fake results; see for example electromagnetic forces and the decades-long history of memristors <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_RejectingMemristor:2018">[1]</a>. Moreover, we assumed an isotropic medium (unlike complex biological objects). The current may delay, disappear, and re-appear in an improperly designed measurement. It is not against the laws of physics; it is due to the incomplete knowledge of physics.</p>
<p>A "conductance meter" device <em>actively applies a potential field that affects the measured object</em>. It assumes that the tested object is passive (also in the sense that switching that field on causes no structural change in the medium) and is in a field-less stationary electric state. <em>The device calculates the displayed result as if the object were metal and no foreign current or voltage was present.</em> For active components (the measured object actively reacts to the applied voltage, and even for resistors used in actively working electric circuits), it provides fake measurement results: it calculates resistance/conductance using Ohm's Law from its input data that contains "foreign" current contribution(s).</p>
<p>In the case of a biological membrane, no charge carriers are present in its resting state. However, the applied voltage may open voltage-controlled ion channels, and the field may move the ions through them. <em>The device sees its own effect: the voltage it applies generates ion inflow, moves the ions it produces, and measures the resulting output current.</em> Different devices and different settings provide different conductance values for the same membrane. (Assuming some resting conduction in axons is a self-contradiction. To have conduction, charge carriers need to be present, which means the presence of ions that means potential above the resting potential. Those ions flow out to the galvanically connected membrane. <em>The measurement device generates the conductance attributed to axons and membrane</em>, which are resting conductance. A systematic error due to the incomplete understanding of the physics of electric measurements. See Fig. 6 in <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[25]</a>. at high clamp voltage, the device's voltage contribution is insignificant. However, it is at least comparable to the measured effect at low clamp voltage.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>one must forget to make parallels with the single-speed electric circuits</em>, especially using their ready-made equations (used outside their range of validity). Biological interactions are governed by more complex laws, especially if interactions at enormously different speeds play a role. However, like in the case of modern versus classic physics, the first principles can provide good hints in the limiting case. If we face a controversy, we apply the wrong basic assumptions and omissions/approximations. </p>
