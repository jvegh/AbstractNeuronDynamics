<p>As we mentioned, with discovering new facts and more details, not only they need to be inserted into the existing set, but the validity of assumptions and approximations must be revisited. Maybe the new discovery supersedes one or more of the old items, provides a new hypothesis in place of an old one, turn a hypothesis to fact, or question marks the overall validity (at least part) of the set of the approximations and abstractions.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_FALLACIES"></a>
Modeling fallacies</h1>
<p>Neuroanatomy provided unbelievable wealth of details of the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_CNS">CNS</a>, its structure, components, their infinite variety of implementation, connection, chemical/enzimatical composition, and so on. A vast amount of data are collected and is available, and uncountable attemps (mathematical models) have been made to describe the actual phenomena. However, focusing on the too many details prevents understanding that <em>the nervous systems adopts a number of basic principles</em> <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_JohstonWuNeurophysiology:1995">[31]</a>. The illusion of the really impressive knowledge base inspired undertaking such as simulating the entire human brain.</p>
<p>The brain must be studied really "from Inside Out" <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_BuzsakiTheBrain:2019">[11]</a>. First of all, understanding how the known and established physical laws underpin the operation of single neurons (the interface of non-living matter and living matter) instead of hypothesizing additional laws and phenomena complementing/overwriting them, creating a fictive nature, which in some points resemblant to the real one. The abstraction, that discrete components connected by ideal wires can describe the electric phenomena, is successful in electronics. However, it is not valid for neurons, although some rough resemblance surely exists. The basic differences are that <em>the structure of living matter is different and that many interactions having drastically different interaction speeds are behind the phenomena</em>, as contrasted with the (mostly) single interaction having a single speed of electronics.</p>
<p>Nature bases on the collective operation of single neurons, and is prepared to consider the finite operating and transmitting times, as well as uncertainties/failures of operation, unlike (most) technical networks. However, the usual neural network models <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_BrainNetworkModels:2018">[6]</a> do not consider those differences.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_FALLACIES_POINTLIKE"></a>
Point-like neuron</h2>
<p>The abstraction we need to use always includes simplifications and omissions, depending on which phenomena we want to study. We can, at an elementary level, consider our Earth point-like if we want to describe its orbit around our Sun, and can assume pairwise interaction between them, although for finer details we need to consider its structure and size as well as the disturbing effects of other planets and its Moon. Whether the abstraction of being point-like is valid, depends on the targeted phenomenon.</p>
<p>In the initial investigations, the <em>size of the cells</em> was seens to be much smaller than the <em>size of the their connections</em>. In addition, the axons were much earlier available for experimental investigations, suggesting that the observed signals originate and terminate in the nodes of the network. This abstraction might be appropriate (with some limitations, mainly due to the connection speed) until we can develop technical tools to study the <em>internal operation</em> of the nodes of the network. A point-like neuron has no physical size, consequently its membrane has no potential difference, its internal operations and phenomena can only have an artificial timing, its input signals are artificially correlated with each other, its mystic internal operation produces an action potential as an output signal in a pair-wise interaction.</p>
<p>When starting from 'the so-called point representation of a neuron" @cite KochBiophysics:1999, admitting that "such an approximation would be valid, for instance, if we were investigating a small, spherical cell without a significant dendritic tree", we
necessarily arrive at the conclusion that "individual neurons convert the incoming streams of binary pulses into analog, spatially distributed variables". This point of view blocks the interpretation of even the correctly seen phenomena and leads to the design of wrong experiments. An immediate consequence of interpreting neuronal communication as streams of binary pulses leads to applying Shannon's mathematical theory to neural communication, despite Shannon's opposition <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_ShannonBandwagon:1956">[51]</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_FALLACIES_PASSIVE"></a>
Passive distributed membrane</h2>
<p>The role of the neuronal membrane is rather controversial as physiology. As <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_KochBiophysics:1999">[32]</a> discusses, 'from an electrical point of view, the properties of the membrane can be satisfactorily described by a sole element: a capacitance.' However, on the same page, caption of Figure 1.1 explains that 'Proteins inserted into the membrane, here ionic channels, provide a conduit through the membrane.' Also, the 'ass ociated lumped electrical circuit for this patch, consisting of a capacitance and a resistance <em>in series</em> with a battery' (and parallel with each other). The attached equivalent figure shows really <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/rc/rc-integrator.html">a passive RC <b>integrator</b> circuit</a> where "the input is connected to a resistance while the output voltage is taken from across a capacitor". That <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#ABSTRACT_ELECTRIC_NEURON">picture is obviously wrong</a>, see also Figure <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#StructureOfAIS">StructureOfAIS</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_FALLACIES_LEAKING"></a>
Membrane as a wrong isolator</h2>
<p>When assuming that membrane's resistance and capacitance are distributed over its surface, on must also assume that the membrane is imperfect resistance; despite that there are no known mechanisms that could conduct an ionic current. The membrane is a perfect isolator, connected to a resistance represented by neuron's <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. The ionic current (although it is not a 'leaking current') can flow out through it. The right picture that the capacitor and resistor are connected serially, instead of parallel as introduced several decades ago, defies the fallacy that the membrane is a non-perfect isolator.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_FALLACIES_K_CURRENT"></a>
'Delayed rectifier' current</h2>
<p>As a consequence of using, by mistake, integrator-type instead of differentiator-type \(RC\) circuit, the textbooks (see for example <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MolecularBiology:2002">[2]</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26910/bin/ch11f27.jpg">figure 11.27</a>), explain that 'the membrane potential would have simply relaxed back to the resting value after the initial depolarizing stimulus if there had been no voltage-gated ion channels in the membrane'. This statement is wrong. The figure refers to an electric integrator-type circuit instead of a neuronal oscillator.</p>
<p>There is no \(K^+\) current. The explanation that 'the efflux of \(K^+\) through \(K^+\) channels, which open in response to membrane depolarization' <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MolecularBiology:2002">[2]</a> is wrong. As we described, the \(Na^+\) ions form for a short time (a small fraction of millisecond) a thin \(Na^+\)-rich layer on the intracellular side of the membrane (this effect is misinterpreted as ions adsorption <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Hodgkin-HuxleyAdsorption:2021">[24]</a>), and correspondingly, a \(Na^+\)-poor layer on the extracellular side. The very strong repulsive force would prevent \(K^+\) ions in the intracellular side to reach their specific ion channels, even if the \(K^+\) channels would 'know' when to open. The driving force for \(K^+\) would act in the opposite direction. (How big the driving force could be, can be understood from <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MolecularBiology:2002">[2]</a>, chapter 11: 'The interior of the resting neuron or muscle cell is at an electrical potential about 50–100 mV more negative than the external medium. Although this potential difference seems small, it exists across a plasma membrane only about 5 nm thick, so that the resulting voltage gradient is about 100,000 V/cm.' The diameter of the ion channel is about 0.1 nm, and 'two \(K^+\) ions in single file within the selectivity filter, separated by about 8 Å. Mutual repulsion between the two ions is thought to help move them through the pore into the extracellular fluid." <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MolecularBiology:2002">[2]</a></p>
<p>Fortunately, the correct differentiator-type circuit produces the 'hyper-polarized' <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> voltage time course (below the resting potential) alone, without needing to hypothesize some (unphysical) 'ghost' current.</p>
<p>As <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__MEMBRANE.html#MODELING_SINGLE_MEMBRANE">we discussed</a>, the rushed-in \(Na^+\) ions produce a 'traveling wave' on the membrane. However, <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MolecularBiology:2002">[2]</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26910/bin/ch11f28.gif">figure 11.28</a>, shows that potential only on the axon. The textbook skips the conclusion that a traveling wave spreads over the membrane, because it would kill the starting hypothesis that <em>the membrane is isopotential during generating an Action Potential.</em></p>
<p>The effect of the ion channels alone cannot produce a traveling wave. However, as we discuss, the rushed-in ions create a huge charge density on the membrane's surface, and that charge can exit only through the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. That macroscopic 'slow current' on the intracellular side of the membrane, on the differentiator-type \(RC\) circuit, produces the 'traveling wave' observed about the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> and along the axon. At the time of publishing the book <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MolecularBiology:2002">[2]</a>, the structure of <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_AxonInitialSegmentStructure:2018">[29]</a> was not known. Now it is. It is high time to fix the neuronal circuit type and <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL">explain creating the Action Potential</a> with a correct model, from the first principles of science.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_NEURONAL_MEMBRANE_REFRACTORINESS"></a>
Membrane refrectoriness</h2>
<p><a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html">membrane refrectoriness </a> As <a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x39.png">membrane refrectoriness </a></p>
<p>We also discuss that when introducing the notion of "slow current", no relative and absolute refractoriness exist: in the period which is called "relative refractory" in the time-independent discussion, is an illusion: the slow currents received through the synapses a couple of dozens of microseconds earlier need time to reach <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. In that period the output voltage on <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> is below the resting potential, so their exciting contribution is much harder to observe. However,</p>
<p>The causality is reversed: not "the minimal distance between two spikes defines the absolute refractory period
of the neuron". Instead, as we discuss, until the membrane's potential is above the threshold (which period is defined by physiological parameters), the synaptic inputs are closed, so if another spike arrives until the synapses are re-opened, it is neglected.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_FALLACIES_LOWPASSFILTER"></a>
Membrane as low-pass filter</h2>
<p>As we discuss in sections <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR.html#PHYSICS_MEASURING_OSCILLATOR">Electric oscillator</a> and <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#ABSTRACT_ELECTRIC_NEURON">Electronics' view of neuronal membrane</a>, the electric operation of neurons resemble electric oscillator circuits. They belong to <em>differentiator</em> type oscillators that belong to high-pass filters in the world of instant interaction of electronics. Despite this fact, see section <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC">Electric operation</a>, neurophysiology assumes that 'the cell membrane composed of a resistance and a capacitance in parallel (RC circuit)' which is an <em>integrator</em> type circuit and it should show the signs of a Low-Pass Filter. The experimental work <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_LowPassFilter_Carandini:1996">[12]</a> (their figure is reproduced in <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_KochBiophysics:1999">[32]</a> as Fig. 1.4), 'demonstrated' experimentally the 'low-pass' behavior of their neuron. It shows an example when one proves what they want to believe.</p>
<p>The basic issue with the evaluation of their data is the basic misunderstanding of neuron's function. <em>A neuron does not pass signals: it receives ones and produces new signals</em>; so it is senseless to check its signal-passing feature. Any foreign input current into the membrane, whether it is noise or a sine signal, increases momentary and average resting potential of the membrane, that is, decreases the probability that the synaptic trigger arrives at a moment when the synaptic input is enabled. With increasing the frequency of that foreign signal, more input current increases membrane's voltage. The longer the membrane voltage is above its threshold potential, the less is the chance to re-open neuron's synaptic inputs, i.e., to receive inputs from the 'regularly firing cell': the triggers arrive with high probabilty in the absolute refractory period. In a later research it was noticed that <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_DepolarizationBianchi:2012">[8]</a> the too high current really blocks spiking (more precisely, receiving the triggering signal).</p>
<p>From our conceptual model of generating <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> (see Fig. <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#fig_AP_Conceptual">fig_AP_Conceptual</a>) it is immediately clear that although in the 'natural mode' of operation the falling edge of the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> would result in that the membrane's voltage falls below the threshold, in this way re-enabling synaptic inputs. However, in 'artificial' mode, the foreign current can keep the voltage above the threshold (for shorter or longer periods, additionally), so the synaptic signal cannot enter the membrane, given that in periods when the membrane has potential value above the threshold, the synaptic inputs are not enabled. The synaptic inputs are re-enabled only when the membrane's potential is under the threshold potential when a new synaptic trigger arrives. That is, the triggering effect of the "regularly firing cells" is supressed by the artificially increased neuronal membrane voltage. The effect has nothing to do with the effect 'Low-Pass Filter'. </p>
