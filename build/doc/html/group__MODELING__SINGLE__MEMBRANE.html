Modeling membrane</h1>
<p>For the sake of the discussion in this section (explaining semi-quantitatively <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL">action potential</a> is created) we assume the neuron's membrane as a long, narrow and thin rectangular isolating surface with controlled ion channels in its wall, junctions at different points for controlled synaptic current inputs, furthermore a specific point for output current/voltage, the Axon Initial Segment (<a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>). The current flowing on the membrane's surface comprises ions, which represent a kind of <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT.html#PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT">slow current</a>. When we use the shorthand wording 'on the surface' in connection with ion currents, we mean that 'in the layer of the electrolyte in the immediate proximity of the isolating semipermeable membrane'.</p>
<p>On the surface of the isolating membrane the electric processes attempt to maintain equal potentials. The <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> represents a permanent (but voltage-dependent) drain current \( I_{AIS}\), the synaptic inputs \( I_{SYN,i}\) contribute (time-dependent and gated) continuous input currents; with a characteristic time comparable to that of the characteristic time of the action pontential. Furthermore, there is a delta-function-like contribution due to the ions rushing into the intracellular space when the ion channels in membrane's wall open at reaching the threshold voltage. In experimental investigations, a clamping voltage \( I_{CLAMP}\) is switched to an axon (it <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON.html#MODELING_SINGLE_AXON">generates current</a>, despite that it is intended to be a voltage generator) or \( I_{DIRECT}\) current is introduced directly into the cell.</p>
<p>Once the ion channels in the membrane's wall open, ions from the adjacent layer in the extracellular space enter the membrane. The ions entering the intracellular surface promptly (in a very small fraction of millisecond) increase the local potential, so they, in an avalanche-like way, open all <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ION__CHANNEL.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ION_CHANNEL">ion channels</a> in their proximity, in a very short period. 'The description just given of an action potential concerns only a small patch of plasma membrane. The self-amplifying depolarization of the patch, however, is sufficient to depolarize neighboring regions of membrane, which then go through the same cycle. In this way, the action potential spreads as a traveling wave from the initial site of depolarization to involve the entire plasma membrane' <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MolecularBiology:2002">[2]</a>. That is, the depolarization happens in an avalanche-like way <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_NeuronalAvalanches:2003">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>The ions on the extracellular side move with their diffusion speed, maybe assisted by a mutual repulsion (if a gradient exists), but they are assisted by the enormous voltage gradient when they pass the open ion channels. The enormous speed difference results in forming an 'empty' layer on the extracellular side, and a 'filled' layer on the intracellular side. The ion inflow stops shortly due to the lack of ions, the ions channels close and remain inactivated for some time (a larger fraction of millisecond). There is no need to open some \(K^+\) channels (BTW: assuming an outward \(K^+\) current is against charge conservation) and control \(K^+\) and \(Na^+\) ion channels: the different interaction speeds and finite sizes do all the business.</p>
<p>As <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MolecularBiology:2002">[2]</a> discusses in connection with ions' passage through the ion channels, 'mutual repulsion between the two ions is thought to help move them through the pore into the extracellular fluid', given that the distance between those ions is in the range of a small fraction on \(nm\). We assume that that repulsion can create a thin 'charged' layer in the range of \(0.1\ nm\) on top of the few \(nm\) thick membrane. Furthermore, the repulsion can effectively assist both advancing the ions along the surface and keeping membrane's surface equipotential. As we described, the \(Na^+\) ions form for in a short time (a small fraction of millisecond) a thin \(Na^+\)-rich layer on the intracellular side of the membrane (this effect is misinterpreted as ion adsorption <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Hodgkin-HuxleyAdsorption:2021">[26]</a>), and correspondingly, a \(Na^+\)-poor layer on the extracellular side. The 'empty' layer on the extracellular side can be filled up with ions from the enormous pool, and also the ions at the very first segment of axon flow into the extracellular part (see for example <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a>, Figure 18). The extracellular circle begins with the rushed-in ions from the extracellular side that ions 'disappear' into the intracellular side and 're-appear' (with a \(0.5\ ms\) delay, see the same figure). The charge conservation is valid only with a time delay. On the intracellular side of the membrane, ions 'appear' when the \(Na^+\) channels open and the ions 'disappear' through the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> with a \(0.5\ ms\) delay. <em>The picture is consistent, the charge conservation is valid, but only if we take into account that the ion current is slow</em> <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SPEEDS.html#PHYSICS_SPEEDS_FINITE">as we described</a>. See also the <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#fig_The-ghost-image_AP">fig_The-ghost-image_AP</a> and its explanation.</p>
<p>The ions entering the membrane (in some sense, in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the membrane) charge the membrane to its saturation value with a large time constant. The charges, under the effect of electrostatic repulsion and the voltage gradient due to the current drain at the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>, start to move along the dendritic surface, forming a macroscopic slow current. The charges 'created' at different distances from the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> need different times to arrive at it, creating charge, mechanical, etc. waves on the surface <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MechanicalWaves:2015">[19]</a>. We assume that the neuron'al's membrane is equipotential, but its dendritic tree is not equipotential (essentially, this is the implicit assumption of the multi-compartment models <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MultiCompartmentNeurons:2023">[58]</a>).</p>
<p>The membrane is considered as an equipotential insulator piece surface, and its operation is thought to be closely aligned with that of an electric <em>RC</em> circuit. That model, because of choosing the wrong way of connecting the elements in the circuit, needs introducing fake physical and enzimatical mechanisms as well as defining mathematical relations between independently operating biological components. Unlike that model, our abstract model considers the correct behavior of different interactions operating those abstract components, and can explain the operation of a neuron from the first principles of science. Among others, that controling the ion channels in membranes's wall, inhibiting its synaptic inputs in well-defined phases of creating an action potential, emitting an <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL">action potential</a> <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> with its precise shape and timing, are a natural consequence of receiving finite-speed currents by a finite-size neuronal membrane.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_MEMBRANE_RUSHEDIN"></a>
The rushed-in current</h2>
<p>The most intense current in a neuron is its charge-up current. The membrane's chargeup current (in our approximation) is an instant current: the ions rush in into the intracellular space in a very short time. The ions rushing in into the intracellular space, on the entire surface of the membrane, actually pass the ion channel proportional to the vast gradient across the membrane surfaces (in our approach: instantly) and they quickly reach a saturation level (in the thin layer they create on the top of the membrane on the intracellular side), meaning that both the voltage due to the rushed-in current and the current that can flow away will be saturated, with a short time constant. Given that the elevated membrane potential is connected to the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>, a current can start. However, only the ions in the segment in front of the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> can pass its ion channels, so the ions farther from <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> first have to reach that segment, that takes time. These two processes happen at the same time, so the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> will see the resulting current</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} I_{MEMB}(t,x) = (1-\exp(-a*t))*exp(-b*t) \label{eq:MembraneCurrent} \end{equation}
</p>
<p>where \(a\) and \(b\) are time constants describing the charge-up and discharge processes. The inflow is extremely quick and the ions shall diffuse to a small distance (as we estimate, \(\approx 10^{-10}\ m\) with their speed \(10^{-5}\ m/s\), so probably the repulsion of ions defines the saturation time constant \(a\)) in the proximity of the exit of the ion channel. The ion current intensity decays with time constant \(b\), closely related to ions speed through the \(I_{AIS}\), see sections <a class="el" href="group__MEASURING__CURRENT.html#MEASURING_CURRENT">Current vs charge transfer</a> and <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC">Electric operation</a>.</p>
<p>When the ion channels in membrane's wall open, ions from the adjacent layer in the extracellular space enter the membrane. The ions entering the intracellular surface promptly (in a very small fraction of millisecond) increase the local potential, so they in an avalanche-like way open all <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ION__CHANNEL.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ION_CHANNEL">ion channels</a> in their proximity, in a very short period. 'The description just given of an action potential concerns only a small patch of plasma membrane. The self-amplifying depolarization of the patch, however, is sufficient to depolarize neighboring regions of membrane, which then go through the same cycle.

That is, the depolarization happens in an avalanche-like way <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_NeuronalAvalanches:2003">[8]</a> and the evidence of existance of traveling waves <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MechanicalWaves:2015">[19]</a> is known since decades.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_MEMBRANE_AIS"></a>
The AIS outflow current</h2>
<p>The membrane is an exceptionally good isolator (in contrast with the statements about the 'leaking current'), but at one end, at the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> the ions can exit to the extracellular space (the membrane is "leaking" only in the picture where a distributed resistance in parallel with a distributed condenser is assumed). The resistance/conductance of <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> limits the current. The current outflow decreases the potential and the ions from the higher potential will move (in form of a macroscopic current) towards the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. Two factors regulate the process. The first one is how quickly the ions can flow out through <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>: the current is proportional to the potential difference above resting potential. The second one is how quickly the ions can travel towards the potential gradient: <a class="el" href="group__MEASURING__CURRENT.html#MEASURING_CURRENT">the current is proportional to the local driving force</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> represents a non-distributed discrete resistance \(R_M\), and correspondingly the current</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} I_{AIS} = - \frac{V_M-V_{rest}}{R_M} \label{eq:I_AIS} \end{equation}
</p>
<p> (it is an outward current, so it is negative). As long as a potential difference exists between the membrane and the extracellular space, an ion current will flow through the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>.</p>
<p>The presence of <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> leads to "leaking": a <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT.html#PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT">slow current</a> (represented by slow ions) on the surface of the intracellular side will flow in parallel with the surface into the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. Given that those ion channels have no voltage threshold, the current can flow at any potential difference, creating the illusion of "leaking".</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_MEMBRANE_SYNAPTIC"></a>
Synaptic currents and refractoriness</h2>
<p>As we know, after reaching the membrane's threshold potential, the axonal arbors stop emitting ions into the membrane. (The collected charge will not change any more, and so will their collection time: the computational result is ready.) The ions need to propagate against membrane's electric repulsion and, because of the 'downhill' method of propagation, they cannot enter the membrane anymore until its potential decreases below the threshold level again (this period is known as the 'absolute refractory' period); the rest of the spike remains in 'pending' state: it cannot leave the axon of the presynaptic neuron and cannot enter the membrane.</p>
<p>After reaching the threshold, the ion rush-in into the membrane continues for a while, and the membrane's potential increases. The increasing potential drives a current through <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> that decrases membrane's potential (because of the finite speed of ions, they appear with a delay both on the membrane and on the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>).</p>
<p>Another famous point is that when the the membrane potential decreases below the threshold potential, the synaptic inputs can contribute again: the neuron is in phase 'Relaxing' again. This period is mistakenly identied as 'relative refractory' period. Actually, this state is not a 'refractory'; it is in stage 'Relaxing', but starting with an elevated membrane potential. It begins earlier than the first output appears on the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. The slow axonal currents from the re-opened arbors must reach <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>, so they appear there with a delay (from different distances, at different times), creating the <em>illusion that inputs are re-enabled only when the membrane voltage is about its hyperpolarized voltage value</em>.</p>
<p>Given that the neuron is actually in a 'Relaxing' stage, &ndash; due to re-opening the axonal inputs &ndash; the pending inputs can contribute again, this time to the 'next' spike. In this period the initial neuronal potential differs from its resting value: it implements a short-term (time-dependent) <em>neuronal memory</em>, see also Figure <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#fig_AP_Conceptual">fig_AP_Conceptual</a>. The pending contribution is the larger the closer was the time of closing the arboral gates to the arrival of the synaptic input; a plausible explanation of Hebb's observation. Althought the 'pending' current can diffuse over the dendritic tree, maybe over different synapses, it can contribute to the 'next' spike.</p>
<p>With introducing the idea of 'slow current', we arrive at a clear interpretation of the observed refractory period. The synaptic inputs are closed when membrane's potential is above the threshold potential, and they are open below that value. This distinction may be important in the presence of 'artificial' currents (clamping and patching): that current adds a potential offset to the voltage level; furthermore, the patching current may arrive through a 'valved' axon. If that offset becomes higher than the threshold, no synaptic input can be received. Actually, the refractory period reflects an 'all or nothing' feature of the synapses: they are either open or closed, without a third state.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html">membrane refrectoriness </a> and figure <a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x39.png">membrane refrectoriness </a></p>
<p>(Notice in Figure <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE.html#fig_NeuronElectricOperationSummary">fig_NeuronElectricOperationSummary</a> that although the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> with its hyperpolarization arrives to the synapse, the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_PSP">PSP</a> is not hyperpolarized.)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_MEMBRANE_OTHER"></a>
The physical picture</h2>
<p>The ions entering the membrane (in some sense, in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the membrane) charge the membrane to its saturation value with a large time constant. The charges, under the effect of electrostatic repulsion and the voltage gradient due to the current drain at the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>, start to move along the membrane's surface, forming a macroscopic slow current. Given that the electrostatic interaction is very strong, we may assume that the neuronal membrane is equipotential, except the region immediately in front of the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> where the current drain works. The charges 'created' at different distances from the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> need different times to arrive.</p>
<p>However, their time course is different: the slow currents need different travel time and the different contributions have different time distributions. In the case of biology, the gating mechanisms complicate the process The membrane charge-up starts only when the membrane's voltage is above the membrane's threshold voltage, and conversely, the synaptic inputs are active only when the membrane's voltage is below the membrane's threshold voltage. The patching and clamping contributions have external control. The resulting output voltage measurable on the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> simply comprises <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_OPERATION">the sum of all those contributions</a>. The time derivatives of the different voltages can be calculated using different physical models.</p>
<p>Unlike that model, our abstract model considers the correct behavior of different interactions operating those abstract components, and can explain the operation of a neuron from the first principles. Among others, that controling the ion channels in membranes's wall, inhibiting its synaptic inputs in well-defined phases of creating an action potential, emitting an <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL">action potential</a> <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> with its precise shape and timing, are a natural consequence of receiving finite-speed currents by a finite-size neuronal membrane. <a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/">Neuronal dynamics</a></p>
<p>The "leaking current" \( I_{AIS}\) is active all the time. It is proportional to the difference of the <em>potential at <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> above the resting potential</em>, and the ion channels in <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> can be characterized by a discrete \(R\) resistance value. The synaptic inputs \( I_{SYN,i}\) are active only in the charge-up and relative refractory period (actually, when <em>the membrane potential is below the threshold value</em>: otherwise the ions cannot enter the intracellular space against the higher membrane potential)</p>
<p>The slow ions (representing the charge-up and synaptic entry currents, as well as the 'artificial currents' due to patching or clamping) need time to traverse from their entry point to the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. In this abstraction there is no place for an ideal conductor wiring. In some cases these differences matter and the classic neuronal membrane model commonly used in biology is misleading; especially the picture that suggests that resistance and capacitance are both discributed and are in parallel; there is no place for <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> as a separated (and discrete) element. See also discussing the <a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x12.png">electrical properties of neuron </a> "The cell membrane acts like a capacitor in parallel with a resistor". No, it is wrong: the circuit is serial.</p>
<p>From this point on, all discussion is wrong: "Because the insulator is not perfect, the charge will, over time, slowly leak through the cell membrane." No, the insulator is perfect (BTW, there is no mechanism that could conduct); but the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> is a good conductor, and it is always on since it is in series with the disctributed condenser. If we "split the driving current into two components" <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a>, we are wrong: the circuit has serially switched components, we cannot cut it. Not much sense to analize <a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online">\(\delta\) functions, Fourier series, and so on</a>. The conclusion of the elegant discussion is also wrong: 'we no longer have to worry about the time course of the membrane potential during the application of the current pulse:' 'the membrane potential simply jumps at time \(t=0\) by an amount \(q/C\)'. In this picture, has no sense to ask: <em>why the potential jumps</em>? Especially, without change of charge. Yes, the fact that the neuronal circuit is a <em>serially switched \(RC\) oscillator</em>, and not a parallel one, has far-reaching consequences.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_MEMBRANE_CONDENSER"></a>
The neuronal condenser</h2>
<p>As discussed in connection with <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ION__CHANNEL.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ION_CHANNEL">ion channels</a>, when the membrane voltage exceeds its critical threshold value, ions from the extracellular space rush into the intracellular space. During that process, for a very short time, a thin layer of positive ions is formed on the intracellular side, and another thin layer on the extracellular side with the lack of positive ions (the layer from which the ions escaped). This configuration of ions resembles condenser plates with ions of opposite charge on the two sides. Notice, hovever, that "the ideal wire" between the plates is distributed through the plates, and the current flows only for a very limited period. At the same time, ions will diffuse on the extracellular side into the emptied layer, a current perpendicular to the surface. The current loop closes through the extracellular space and the very first part of the axon.</p>
<p>The membrane's capacitance should be interpreted differently: the presence of charge on the intracellular side means also the presence of a potential gradient. The ions are 'stored' only in the sense that they are inside the distributed capacitor while they traverse from their entry point to the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>.</p>
