Modeling membrane</h1>
<p>Once, the ion channels in membrane's wall open, and ions from the adjacent layer in the extracellular space enter the membrane. The ions entering the intracellular surface promptly (in a very small fraction of millisecond) increase the local potential, so they in an avalanche-like way open all <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ION__CHANNEL.html#MODELING_ION_CHANNEL">ion channels</a> in their proximity, in a very short period. 'The description just given of an action potential concerns only a small patch of plasma membrane. The self-amplifying depolarization of the patch, however, is sufficient to depolarize neighboring regions of membrane, which then go through the same cycle. In this way, the action potential spreads as a traveling wave from the initial site of depolarization to involve the entire plasma membrane' <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MolecularBiology:2002">[2]</a>. That is, the depolarization happens in an avalanche-like way.</p>
<p>The ions on the extracellular side move with their diffusion speed, but they use their high thermal speed to pass the open ion channels. As the textbook <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MolecularBiology:2002">[2]</a>, chapter 11 discusses the 'transport efficiency of ion channels is \(10^5\) times greater than the fastest rate of transport mediated by any known carrier protein'). The process (the enormous speed difference) results in forming an 'empty' layer on the extracellular side, and a 'filled' layer on the intracellular side. The ion inflow stops shortly due to the lack of ions, the ions channels close and remain inactivated for some time (a larger fraction of millisecond) There is no need to open some \(K^+\) channels (BTW: assuming an outward \(K^+\) current is against charge conservation) and control \(K^+\) and \(Na^+\) ion channels: the different interaction speeds and finite sizes do all the business. As the textbook <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MolecularBiology:2002">[2]</a> discusses As we described, the \(Na^+\) ions form for a short time (a small fraction of millisecond) a thin \(Na^+\)-rich layer on the intracellular side of the membrane (this effect is misinterpreted as ion adsorption <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Hodgkin-HuxleyAdsorption:2021">[19]</a>), and correspondingly, a \(Na^+\)-poor layer on the extracellular side. The 'empty' layer on the extracellular side can be filled up with ions from the enormous pool, and also the ions at the very first segment of axon flow into the extracellular part (see for example <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[20]</a>, Figure 18). The extracellular circle begins with the rushed-in ions from the extracellular side that ions 'disappear' into the intracellular side and 're-appear' (with a \(0.5\ ms\) delay, see the same figure). The charge conservation is valid only with a time delay. On the intracellular side of the membrane, ions 'appear' when the \(Na^+\) channels open and the ions 'disappear' through the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> with a \(0.5\ ms\) delay. <em>The picture is consistent, the charge conservation is valid, but only if we take into account that the ion current is slow</em> <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SPEEDS.html#PHYSICS_SPEEDS_FINITE">as we described</a>. See also the <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#fig_The-ghost-image_AP">fig_The-ghost-image_AP</a> and its explanation.</p>
<p>The ions entering the membrane (in some sense, in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the membrane) charge the membrane to its saturation value with a large time constant. The charges, under the effect of electrostatic repulsion and the voltage gradient due to the current drain at the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>, start to move along the membrane's surface, forming a macroscopic slow current. Given that the electrostatic interaction is very strong, we may assume that the neuronal membrane is equipotential, except the region immediately in front of the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> where the current drain works. The charges 'created' at different distances from the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> need different times to arrive.</p>
<p>The membrane is considered as infinitesimally small ("point-like") equipotential insulator piece surface, and its operation is thought to be closely aligned with that of an electric <em>RC</em> circuit. That model needs introducing fake physical and enzimatical mechanisms as well as defining mathematical relations between independently operating biological components.</p>
<p>Unlike that model, our abstract model considers the correct behavior of different interactions operating those abstract components, and can explain the operation of a neuron from the first principles. Among others, that controling the ion channels in membranes's wall, inhibiting its synaptic inputs in well-defined phases of creating an action potential, emitting an <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL">action potential</a> <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> with its precise shape and timing, are a natural consequence of receiving finite-speed currents by a finite-size neuronal membrane. <a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/">Neuronal dynamics</a></p>
<p>For the sake of the discussion in this section (explaining semi-quantitatively <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL">action potential</a> is created) we assume the neuron's membrane as a long, narrow and thin rectangular isolating surface with controlled ion channels in its wall, junctions at different points for controlled synaptic current inputs, furthermore a specific point for output current/voltage, the Axon Initial Segment (<a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>). The current flowing on the membrane comprises ions, which represent a kind of <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT.html#PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT">slow current</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="TOREVISE"></a>
Yet to be revised</h1>
<p>The ions rushing in the intracellular space, on the entire surface of the membrane, actually pass the ion channel with their thermal speed (in our approach: instantly) and they quickly reach a saturation level, meaning that both the voltage and the current that can flow away will be saturated, with a short time constant: the inflow is extremely quick and the ions shall diffuse to a small distance in the vicinity of the exit of the ion channel. That elevated membrane potential is connected to the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> (represented as resistance \(R\), and a current can start. However, only the ions in the infinitesimal segment immediately in front of the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> can pass its ion channels, so the ions farther from <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> first have to reach that infinitesimal segment, that takes time. These two processes happen at the same time, so the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> will see the resulting current</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} I_{MEMB}(t,x) = (1-\exp(-a*t))*exp(-b*t) \label{eq:MembraneCurrent} \end{equation}
</p>
<p>For the simple case when the threshold potential have been reached, the synaptic inputs get blocked and no "foreign" current is present, Kirchoff's Junction Law can be described as</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} C\frac{dV}{dt}+\frac{V(t,x)-V_{rest}}{R}+I_{MEMB}(t,x) =0 \label{eq:Kirchoffspartial} \end{equation}
</p>
<p>where \(C\) is the capacity that can be interpreted for the system, see also <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT.html#PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT">how the classic physics imitates slow current</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_STAGES"></a>
Currents in different stages</h2>
<p>The membrane's chargeup current (in our approximation) is an instant current: the ions rush in into the intracellular space in a very short time. After that, the ion current saturates at all locations over the membrane (in some sense, in direction 'perpendicularly' to membrane's surface). The membrane is an exceptionally good isolator, but at one end, at the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> the ions can exit to the extracellular space. The resistance/conductance of <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> limits the current. The current outflow decreases the potential near to the outflow point and the ions from the higher potential will move towards the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. Two factors regulate the process. The first one is how quickly the ions can flow out through <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>: the current is proportional to the potential difference above resting potential. The second one is how quickly the ions can travel towards the potential gradient: the current is proportional to the local driving force.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="ABSTRACT_ELECTRIC_NEURON_CURRENTS_CHARGEUP"></a>
The charge-up current</h1>
<p>The most intense current in a neuron is its charge-up current. As discussed in connection with <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ION__CHANNEL.html#MODELING_ION_CHANNEL">ion channels</a>, when the membrane voltage exceeds its critical threshold value, ions from the extracellular space rush into the intracellular space. During that process, for a very short time, a thin layer of positive ions is formed on the intracellular side, and another thin layer on the extracellular side with the lack of positive ions (the layer from which the ions escaped). This configuration of ions resembles condenser plates with ions of opposite charge on the two sides. Notice, hovever, that "the ideal wire" between the plates is distributed through the plates, and the current flows only for a very limited period. At the same time, ions will diffuse on the extracellular side into the emptied layer, a current perpendicular to the surface. The current loop closes through the extracellular space and the very first part of the axon.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="ABSTRACT_ELECTRIC_NEURON_CURRENTS_LEAKING"></a>
The leaking current</h1>
<p>The ion channels in the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> allow ions to escape to the extracellular space. The <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> represents a discrete resistance. As long as a potential difference exists between the membrane and the extracellular space, an ion current will flow through the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. Given that those ion channels have no voltage threshold, ions can flow in both directions.</p>
<p>The presence of <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> leads to "leaking": a <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT.html#PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT">slow current</a> (represented by slow ions) on the surface of the intracellular side will flow in parallel with the surface into the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. The membrane's capacitance should be interpreted differently: the presence of charge on the intracellular side means also the presence of a potential gradient. The ions are 'stored' only in the sense that they are inside the distributed capacitor while they traverse from their entry point to the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. The slow ions (representing the charge-up and synaptic entry currents, as well as the 'artificial currents' due to patching or clamping) need time to traverse from their entry point to the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. In this abstraction there is no place for an ideal conductor wiring. In some cases these differences matter and the classic neuronal membrane model commonly used in biology is misleading (compare it to the circuits shown in Figure <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR.html#RCIntegratorCircuit">RCIntegratorCircuit</a> (<a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_KochBiophysics:1999">[27]</a> Figure 1.1)). Notice that the figure suggests that resistance and capacitance are both discributed; there is no place for <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> as a separated (and discrete) element. See also <a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x12.png">electrical properties of neuron </a> "The cell membrane acts like a capacitor in parallel with a resistor". No, it is wrong: the circuit is serial. From this point on, all discussion is wrong: " Because the insulator is not perfect, the charge will, over time, slowly leak through the cell membrane." No, the insulator is perfect (BTW, there is no mechanism that could conduct); but the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> is a good conductor, and it is always on. If we "split the driving current into two components", we are wrong: the circuit has serially switched components. Not much sense to analize \(\delta\) functions, Fourier series, and so on. The conclusion of the elegant discussion is also wrong: 'we no longer have to worry about the time course of the membrane potential during the application of the current pulse:' 'the membrane potential simply jumps at time \(t=0\) by an amount \(q/C\)'. In this picture, has no sense to ask: <em>why the potential jumps</em>? Yes, the fact that the neuronal circuit is a serially switched \(RC\) oscillator, and not a parallel one, has far-reaching consequences.</p>
