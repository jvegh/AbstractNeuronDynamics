<div class="textblock"><p><em>"Though this be madness, yet there is method in't."</em> (<b>Shakespeare: Hamlet: Act 2 Scene 2</b>)</p>
<h1>Why another neuron(al) simulator</h1>
<p>The dynamic operation of individual neurons, their connections, higher-level organizations and connections, and finally the brain and mind, are still one of the big mysteries of science: <em>at which point the non-living matter becomes a living one, and at which point a living matter becomes intelligent and conscious</em>; whether and how all this stuff can be handled by science. It is at least as complex and sophisticated as the operation of cosmos, with the significant difference that we can experiment with it and the results of experiments become available in much shorter time that billions of years. Still, the unified "theory of everything" is still missing (also) in neuroscience.</p>
<p>The complexity means different constituents interacting in different ways and in various combinations. The features of constituents are well-studied (by the usual scientific methods: isolating objects and their interactions as much as possible in simple combinations) but there are no general methods to study different combinations of interactions with a variety of number of participants. Nature is infinitely complex. Even within the mentioned levels, science fields sometimes use different terminology, <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__INTRODUCTORY.html#PHYSICS_Description">different approximations and abstractions</a>. In the interest of being able to describe nature, one has to pass <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charybdis">between 'Scylla' and 'Charybdis'</a>: being still sufficiently accurate in describing phenomena while keeping its mathematical complexity (and computational need) of description still manageable. An often forgotten point that <em>we need to firmly attach to a formalism which approximation describes the piece of nature in question</em>, exactly in the way as mathematics defines its conditions of applicability (its range of validity). The so called biological models mostly lack a rigorous physical background and jump directly to ad-hoc mathematical formulas that produce some limited resemblance with the observed phenomenon under a limited set of conditions, having little interests whether the constants and functions have the right relation with nature.</p>
<p>This site attempts to synthetise that knowledge with a fresh eye, and intends to make a leap, scrutinizing our knowledge pieces one-by-one, for credibility, relation to other pieces, to other sciences, finding contradictions and its reasons, <em>defying fallacies</em>. The closely related <a class="el" href="MODELING_MAIN_PAGE.html">neuron simulation </a> details are underpinned by <a class="el" href="PHYSICS_MAIN_PAGE.html">physics </a> explanations. The operation of <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_CNS">CNS</a> is closely related to the <a class="el" href="COMPUTING_MAIN_PAGE.html">information processing </a> of the brain. <em>None of the existing simulators handles the mentioned phenomena: they live in the world of the classic science grammatically translated to biological terms. Neither of them handles time as a physically reasonable entity; instead, they consider it as an additional (and mathematically separable) parameter in the Newtonian scene.</em> An (educational, demonstration and research)-purpose <a class="el" href="SIMULATION_MAIN_PAGE.html">simulator</a> attaches the site, with complete code, examples, use cases, reproduced research results and documentation (to the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_API">API</a> documentation through the related <em>modules</em> and <em>classes</em>). <em>Our simulator provides a deeper understanding, a correct physical background, and is the only one where the time is handled as part of the unified space-time.</em> In this site, the science facts are provided as cited references, and in most cases also direct hyperlink makes accessing them easily. Sometimes you may need our <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html">glossary </a> or the search engine (see the right side of the title line).</p>
<p>Today, we have many science fields and subfields, with their historical development, successes and failures, with outdated and not-yet widely known new facts, as well as fallacies. The incremental development is combined with leap-like ones. Inventing even more fine details and especially leap-like developmens inside our own science field or in the fellow sciences needs to check periodically whether our abstractions and approximations are still valid, and &ndash; in the interest of developing our science field further &ndash; sometimes we even need to make fresh starts (i.e., rebuilding partly our science), when replacing part of our knowledge with a more accurate one, not forgetting to check the validity of our conclusions that we based on the right now replaced approximations. The cooperation of science fields frequently results in using methods, notions, devices, etc. from a fellow science field, without considering (and sometimes, without understanding) the range of <a class="el" href="PHYSICS_ABSTRACTIONS_PAGE.html">validity of the abstraction</a> we imply. The case was formulated by <a href="http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/papers/Shannon.IRETransInfoTh1956b.pdf">Shannon</a> <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_ShannonBandwagon:1956">[33]</a> for using <em>communication theory</em> as the basis for what became neuronal <em>information theory</em> "is not a trivial matter of translating words to a new domain". Similarly, using <a class="el" href="PHYSICS_INTRODUCTORY_PAGE.html">physical </a> (mainly <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING.html">electrical</a>), <a class="el" href="COMPUTING_MAIN_PAGE.html">computational </a> terms, notions and formulas in biology, without scrutinizing their range of applicability, may result in explaining some phenomena in a short term, but surely misguides science in the long run. Basically, the static point of view, inherited from anatomy, and considering a biological operation as jump-like changes from state to state (inherited from either atomic or quantum physics or digital electronics) hides that <em>life is based on processes and slow transitions instead</em>.</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b>Please consider that this development is a one-man undertaking, and it shall develop together with its documentation. There are pre-developed code fragments and docs, but it needs time to put them in a consistent state, especially that also development and testing is needed. Please come back later and see if there is something new.</p>
