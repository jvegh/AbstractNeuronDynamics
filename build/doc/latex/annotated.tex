Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}

\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ sc\+Gen\+Comp\+\_\+\+PU\+\_\+\+Abstract} \\*Class to deal with operations of an abstract processing unit (\doxyref{PU}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_PU}), implementing a single-\/shot elementary computation in the sense of the General Computing Paradigm \cite{VeghRevisingClassicComputing:2021}. The stages of operation are marked by event pairs (or single events) in the sense as the SystemC \cite{SystemCBook:2010} programming engine uses that notion. Using those events and SystemC\textquotesingle{}s internal time scale, {\itshape the class isolates the simulated time and the clock time the \doxyref{PU}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_PU} needs to simulate the processing}. The code of this base class is a bit complex, in order to enable simple derived \doxyref{PU}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_PU}s\+: the complex event handling mechanism is confined in this class; the derived classes are free from any SystemC specific programming (for and example see \doxyref{Neuron\+Demo}{p.}{classNeuronDemo}). The \doxyref{PU}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_PU} has correspondingly the stages \textquotesingle{}Computing\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}Delivering\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}Relaxing\textquotesingle{} as the minimum necessary basic states. The module implements a single-\/shot normal operating mode, that is, the operation is automatic between the corresponding xxx\+Begin and xxx\+End events, and at the end of the xxx\+End events the corresponding next xxx\+Begin event is issued. A distinguished (compared to other simulators) feature of the class is handling time faithfully }{\pageref{classscGenComp__PU__Abstract}}{}
