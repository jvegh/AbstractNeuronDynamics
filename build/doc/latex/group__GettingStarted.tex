Nature implemented neural objects in an infinite variety and they cooperate without obvious difficulties because they implement a concrete object that implements general abstract features, with a variety of unique details and part-\/solutions. We remain at this {\itshape abstract level} and refer to the vast number of physiologycal studies describing the concrete features. Our methods enables to discuss the major aspects from the pheomena of natural operation of neurons to analyzing the effects of invasive electricity-\/related investigation methods on neuroscience.

One of the worst inheritance of neuroscience is a static view from anatomy, the mathematical framework from the single speed, instant interaction of classic science, the isolated interactions, the single-\/speed interactions

Neuronal operation has a special role in science, on its own right. On its base level its processes are studied, as of non-\/living matter (subject of physics and biophysics), at the next level as of living cells (subject of biology and physiology) and top level of its different collective phenomena, such as brain and mind, are the subject from neuroscience to cognitive sciences and phylosophy. However, decribing nature is usually separated into disjunct fields, dealing with EITHER living material OR non-\/living material OR electronics OR computing OR mathematics, without having really good connection between them. We, to some measure synthesize them, mainly by referring to the relevant papers, book and sites.

Technical sciences (mainly electronics and computing science) have developed to the level where elementary electronic components in number comparable to the elementary components of the \doxyref{CNS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_CNS} can be assembled. Those large systems attempt to resemble each other. On the one side, biology inspires huge electronical systems (from \doxyref{HPC}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_HPC} to \doxyref{ANN}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_ANN}). On the other side, electronic systems (mainly large-\/scale computers, but also special-\/purpose electronic simulators) attemp to imitate brain-\/like biological systems, with goals ranging from simulating the dynamics of molecular processes to creating artificial intelligence. Furthermore, there are attemps to combine and interface them. Although it is commonly accepted that both biological and technical systems process, store and transfer information, very different principles with very limited range of validity are used. Approximations, typically from another science subfields, are used beyond their range of validity, furthermore many commonly used fallacies.
