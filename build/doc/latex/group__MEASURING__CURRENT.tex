The basic idea of biological current was correctly defined at the beginning\+: \textquotesingle{}The permeability of a membrane to a penetrating substance is given quantitatively by the amount of the substance which crosses a unit area of the membrane in unit time under the action of a unit force. In simple cases of ionized substances both the amount of substance and the force acting may be expressed in electrical terms. Then the permeability may be ultimately converted into coulombs per second for a square centimeter and a potential difference of 1 volt, which is the conductance, in reciprocal ohms, for a square centimeter.\textquotesingle{} \cite{COLE_CURTIS_IMPEDANCE:1939} However, at that time physiologically defined fine details were not known.\doxysubsection{Current vs charge transfer}\label{group__MEASURING__CURRENT_MEASURING_CURRENT}
On microscopic scale, a charge creates a potential field and that field acts on another charge; it it moves, it is currentat microscopic level. When describing the macroscopic phenomenon \char`\"{}current\char`\"{} in microscopic terms, we need to understand that we apply a potential difference to a macroscopic piece of space (or measure it) and measure the statistical time course of the charge carriers. These two characteristics are connected through the features of the medium (material) that hosts our measurement. In a conducting wire, there are free charges, their number per unit volume is given by $n$, and $q$ is the amount of charge on each carrier. If the conductor has a cross section of $A$, in the length $dx$ of the wire we have charge $dQ=q*n*A*dx$. If the charges are moving with a macroscopic speed $v=\frac{dx}{dt}$, we define the current as the charge moved per unit time\+:

\begin{equation} I=\frac{dQ}{dt}=q*n*A*v\label{eq:DriftCurrent} \end{equation}

Notice that if any of the factors is zero, the macroscopic current $I$ is zero. {\itshape Microscopic carriers must be present in the volume} and have charge, the cross section must not be zero, and the charge carriers must move with a drift velocity, which usually needs an external force field. According to Stokes\textquotesingle{} Law, to move a spherical object with radius $R$ in a fluid having dynamic viscosity $\eta$, we need a force

\begin{equation} F_{d}=6*\pi*\eta*R*v\label{eq:StokesForce} \end{equation}

(drag force) acting on it. A (microscopic) electric force field $\frac{dV}{dx}$ inside the wire would accelerate the charge carriers continuously

\begin{equation} F_{e}=k\frac{dV}{dx}q \end{equation}

However, the medium in which the charge moves shows a (macroscopic, speed-\/dependent) counterforce $F_{d}$, which in steady state equals $F_{e}$, that is \+:

\begin{equation} I=\frac{k*q^{2}*A}{6*\pi*\eta*R}*n*\frac{dV}{dx}\label{eq:StokesCurrent} \end{equation}

The amount of current in a wire is not only influenced by the electric force field (specific resistance) but also by the number of charge carriers $n$. While the latter is commonly considered constant and part of the former, this is not necessarily the case for biological systems with electrically active structures inside. The medium\textquotesingle{}s internal structure introduces significant modifications. Applying an electric field to a wire can generate varying amounts of current as the number of charge carriers changes. For axons, we use a single-\/degree-\/of-\/freedom system, a viscous damping model, so the {\itshape ions will move with a field-\/dependent constant velocity in the electric space}. However, the activity of potential-\/controlled ion channels in its wall may change $n$ in various ways; furthermore, that change can result in \textquotesingle{}delayed\textquotesingle{} currents during measurement, for example, in clamping.\doxysubsection{Electric MEASURING\+\_\+\+CURRENT\+\_\+\+OSCILLATOR}\label{group__MEASURING__CURRENT_MEASURING_CURRENT_OSCILLATOR}
