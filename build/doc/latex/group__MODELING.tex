\doxysubsubsection{MODELING abstract neurons}\label{MODELING_MAIN_PAGE}
The operation of the \doxyref{CNS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_CNS} is closely related to \doxyref{information processing }{p.}{group__COMPUTING_COMPUTING_MAIN_PAGE} (\textquotesingle{}aka computing\textquotesingle{}) of the brain. Neurons are one of the building stones of the living matter. Of course they do a lot of service activities to keep the cells active and healthy, to supply them with energy. However, for our goals their vital task is to \doxyref{receive, process and issue information}{p.}{group__COMPUTING__BASICS_COMPUTING}, in \doxyref{cooperation with special assemblies}{p.}{group__MODELING__MULTIPLE_MODELING_MULTIPLE_NEURONS} of fellow neurons. Information and computing (in a general sense) play a fundamental role in understanding neuronal operation. When studying \doxyref{CNS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_CNS}, we need to start from cells to circuits \cite{FromCellsToCircuits:2018}, and we can study the brain \textquotesingle{}from inside out\textquotesingle{} \cite{BuzsakiTheBrain:2019}. During this journey we need to keep in mind that we need to use (and with the growing complexity\+: change) the \doxyref{abstractions and approximations}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__ABSTRACTION_PHYSICS_ABSTRACTIONS} used to describe the abstract operation. Sometimes, even in describing the same phenomenon, different approximations must be used for the different participating interactions.

The goal was set \cite{SejnowskiComputationalNeuroscience:1988} decades ago\+: \textquotesingle{}The ultimate aim of computational neuroscience is to explain how electrical and chemical signals are used in the brain to represent and process information\textquotesingle{}. Since then, chemical and enzymatic research has advanced a lot. However, explaining the electrical signals, primarily how the brain uses them to represent and process information, has stalled, mainly because of using wrong approximations of biological reality. Biology uses ad-\/hoc mathematical models (typically lacking physical reality), and they deliver inconsistent, self-\/contradicting predictions, expectations, and interpretations for the real neurons and their networks. No place remains for interpreting the brain\textquotesingle{}s neural information processing as a collective activity of neurons. Furthermore, we cannot discover that technical computing and the brain handle information differently \cite{VeghNeuralShannon:2022}.

However, the theoretical interpretation of the related phenomena is still missing. We make the first steps towards making an abstract understanding the phenomena. In the first chapter, at single-\/neuron level; in the \doxyref{second chapter }{p.}{group__MODELING__MULTIPLE} at \textquotesingle{}neurassembly\textquotesingle{} level (the collective operation). In the third chapter we present how the computing shall be generalized to describe also \doxyref{biological computing systems}{p.}{group__COMPUTING__BASICS_COMPUTING}.
