Without external effect (incoming spikes or experimenter\textquotesingle{}s current injection) the neuron remains in a stable (but dynamic) equilibrium state. The electric potential and concentration between the intracellular and extracellular regions on the two sides of the semipermeable membrane differ. On the intracellular side a negative resting potential is accompanied by low ion concentration. The ions arriving from the external world change that equilibrium state and the neuron attempts to restore that state, using different mechanisms. The neuron is unexpectedly forced to receive external charge (by fellow neurons or the experimenter) and voluntarily receives some charge to compensate its effect. From this point of view, if the external invasion exceeds some tolerance level, the neuron takes measures to restore its resting state, at the price of overcompensating the external effect for some short time. The extracellular space represents an \textquotesingle{}infinite pool\textquotesingle{} of ions for the processes that need extra ions, so we discuss changes only on the intracellular side. If something changes, either new chemicals or charges appear, the intracellular part attempts to restore its stationary state\+: removes the appeared ions in form of moving ions from one side of its semipermeable membrane to the other,

Initially (and without external invasion) the membrane potential has a resting value. In this stage, the gates of external charges are enabled. If the deviation from the resting potential exceeds a critical value, the neuron disables receiving more input charge until the potential can be decreased again below the critical level. The neuron wants to inform the fellow neurons (at the end of its axon) that its threshold level exceeded. To do so, it needs more charge for issuing an intense current pulse. It opens the ion channels in its wall, and ions from the extracellular space rush in, and their appearance increases the membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage. The neuron can remove the excess charge only through its \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}, so ions start to flow out through the ion channels in the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}. The finite size (the path along the current from where the ions enter membrane to the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}) and their finite speed together results in the shape of the \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP}.

Our assumptions on the operation of an abstract neuron for generating an \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP} are summarized in Figure \doxyref{fig\+\_\+\+AP\+\_\+\+Conceptual}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP_fig_AP_Conceptual}. Initally, the potential of the neuronal membrane is at the value of the resting potential and the neuron is in stage \textquotesingle{}Relaxing\textquotesingle{}. When the first synaptic input arrives, the potential value gets higher and the neuron passes into stage \textquotesingle{}Computing\textquotesingle{}. The subsequent neuronal inputs may increase the potential of the membrane above the threshold level. At that point, the result of \textquotesingle{}Computing\textquotesingle{} is ready and the neuron passes to stage \textquotesingle{}Delivering\textquotesingle{}\+: it prepares to transfer its result, the spike, to the downstream neuron(s) through its axon.

When entering \textquotesingle{}Delivering\textquotesingle{}, two simultaneous actions affecting charge collection take place. First, the neuron closes its synaptic inputs and second, opens the ion channels in its membrane\textquotesingle{}s wall. The rushed-\/in ions through membrane\textquotesingle{}s wall very quickly increases the amount of ions on the intracellular surface, and so the membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage increases. The appearance of ions on the surface is instant, but it takes time until the ions create a saturated layer on the surface. The presence of the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} represents a current drain, that causes a potential gradient. The ions on the surface will move along the gradient, with their finite speed. The ions entering the intracellular side near to the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} will flow out immediately after the ions rush in; the ions entering at a place farther from the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} need distance-\/dependent time to reach the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}. Util ions traveling from the most distant point reach the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}, the current at the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} increases. After that, the neuronal condenser discharges. In the inital phase of restoring the resting potential, the membrane \textquotesingle{}stores\textquotesingle{} the ions. In the later period the \textquotesingle{}capacitive current\textquotesingle{} reverses and produces an overshot (hyperpolarization). The effect resembles an underdamped damping oscillation (with a damping ratio $\zeta=\approx 0.3$).

The decreasing ion potential drops below the threshold value, and at that point the synaptic inputs get reenabled. At that point, the membrane potential is not yet restored. The next computation may start from a potential above or below the resting potential\+: the neuronal membrane has a \textquotesingle{}memory\textquotesingle{} (the memory changes the next \textquotesingle{}computing time\textquotesingle{}). It is worth to notice that the slow synaptic current needs time to travel from its entry point to the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}, so they cause a voltage change at the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} at a time when the voltage due to the membrane current is about or after the hyperpolarized state.

Without experimenter\textquotesingle{}s invasion, this happens due to excitations arriving through neuron\textquotesingle{}s synapses. Given that the result of a neuronal computation is its the charge integration time, we call this stage \textquotesingle{}Computing\textquotesingle{}\+: how much time is required until the threshold voltage is reached.\doxysubsubsection{Oscillator models}\label{group__MODELING__ABSTRACT__MEMBRANE_MODELING_NEURONAL_MEMBRANE_OSCILLATOR}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Once, the ion channels in membrane\textquotesingle{}s wall open, and ions from the adjacent layer in the extracellular space enter the membrane. The ions entering the intracellular surface promptly (in a very small fraction of millisecond) increase the local potential, so they in an avalanche-\/like way open all \doxyref{ion channels}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__ION__CHANNEL_MODELING_ION_CHANNEL} in their proximity, in a very short period. \textquotesingle{}The description just given of an action potential concerns only a small patch of plasma membrane. The self-\/amplifying depolarization of the patch, however, is sufficient to depolarize neighboring regions of membrane, which then go through the same cycle. In this way, the action potential spreads as a traveling wave from the initial site of depolarization to involve the entire plasma membrane\textquotesingle{} \cite{MolecularBiology:2002}. That is, the depolarization happens in an avalanche-\/like way.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The ions on the extracellular side move with their diffusion speed, but they use their high thermal speed to pass the open ion channels. As the textbook \cite{MolecularBiology:2002}, chapter 11 discusses the \textquotesingle{}transport efficiency of ion channels is $10^5$ times greater than the fastest rate of transport mediated by any known carrier protein\textquotesingle{}). The process (the enormous speed difference) results in forming an \textquotesingle{}empty\textquotesingle{} layer on the extracellular side, and a \textquotesingle{}filled\textquotesingle{} layer on the intracellular side. The ion inflow stops shortly due to the lack of ions, the ions channels close and remain inactivated for some time (a larger fraction of millisecond) There is no need to open some $K^+$ channels (BTW\+: assuming an outward $K^+$ current is against charge conservation) and control $K^+$ and $Na^+$ ion channels\+: the different interaction speeds and finite sizes do all the business. As the textbook \cite{MolecularBiology:2002} discusses As we described, the $Na^+$ ions form for a short time (a small fraction of millisecond) a thin $Na^+$-\/rich layer on the intracellular side of the membrane (this effect is misinterpreted as ions adsorption \cite{Hodgkin-HuxleyAdsorption:2021}), and correspondingly, a $Na^+$-\/poor layer on the extracellular side. The \textquotesingle{}empty\textquotesingle{} layer on the extracellular side can be filled up with ions from the enormous pool, and also the ions at the very first segment of axon flow into the extracellular part (see for example \cite{HodgkinHuxley:1952}, Figure 18). The extracellular circle begins with the rushed-\/in ions from the extracellular side that ions \textquotesingle{}disappear\textquotesingle{} into the intracellular side and \textquotesingle{}re-\/appear\textquotesingle{} (with a $0.5\ ms$ delay, see the same figure). The charge conservation is valid only with a time delay. On the intracellular side of the membrane, ions \textquotesingle{}appear\textquotesingle{} when the $Na^+$ channels open and the ions \textquotesingle{}disappear\textquotesingle{} through the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} with a $0.5\ ms$ delay. {\itshape The picture is consistent, the charge conservation is valid, but only if we take into account that the ion current is slow} \doxyref{as we described}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__SPEEDS_PHYSICS_SPEEDS_FINITE}. See also the \doxyref{fig\+\_\+\+The-\/ghost-\/image\+\_\+\+AP}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC_fig_The-ghost-image_AP} and its explanation.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Twice, the axonal arbors stop emitting ions into the membrane. (The collected charge will not change any more, and so will their collection time\+: the camomputational result is ready.) The ions need to propagate against membrane\textquotesingle{}s electric repulsion and they cannot enter the membrane anymore until its potential decreases below the threshold level again (this period is known as the \textquotesingle{}absolute refractory\textquotesingle{} period); the rest of the spike remains in \textquotesingle{}pending\textquotesingle{} state.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The ion rush-\/in into the mebrane continues for a while, and the membrane\textquotesingle{}s potential increases. The increasing potential drives a current through \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} that decrases membrane\textquotesingle{}s potential (because of the finite speed of ions, they appear with a delay both on the mebrane and on the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}).


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Another famous point is when the the membrane potential decreases below the threshold potential. At that point, the synaptic inputs can contribute again\+: the neuron is in phase \textquotesingle{}Relaxing\textquotesingle{} again. This period is mistakenly identied as \textquotesingle{}relative refractory\textquotesingle{} period. Actually, this state is not a \textquotesingle{}refractory\textquotesingle{}; it is \textquotesingle{}Relaxing\textquotesingle{} starting with an elevated membrane potential. It begins earlier than the first output appears on the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}. The slow axonal currents from the re-\/opened arbors must reach \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}, so they appear there with a delay (from different distances at different times), creating the {\itshape illusion that inputs are re-\/enabled only when the membrane voltage is about its hyperpolarized voltage value}. Given that the neuron is actually in a \textquotesingle{}Relaxing\textquotesingle{} state, -- due to re-\/opening the axonal inputs -- the pending inputs can contribute again, this time to the \textquotesingle{}next\textquotesingle{} spike. In this period the neuronal potential differs from its resting value\+: it implements a short-\/term (time-\/dependent) {\itshape neuronal memory}. The pending contribution is the larger the closer was the time of closing the arboral gates to the arrival of the synaptic input; a plausible explanation of Hebb\textquotesingle{}s observation.
\end{DoxyItemize}

With introducing the idea of \textquotesingle{}slow current\textquotesingle{}, we arrive at a clear interpretation of the observed refractory period. The synaptic inputs are closed when membrane\textquotesingle{}s potential is above the threshold potential, and they are open below that value. This distinction may be important in the presence of \textquotesingle{}artificial\textquotesingle{} currents (clamping and patching)\+: the current adds a potential offset to the voltage level; furthermore, the patching current may arrive through a \textquotesingle{}valved\textquotesingle{} axon. If that offset becomes higher than the threshold, no synaptic input can be received. Actually, the refractory period reflects an \textquotesingle{}all or nothing\textquotesingle{} feature of the synapses\+: they are either open or closed, without a third state.

The ions entering the membrane (in some sense, in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the membrane) charge the membrane to its saturation value with a large time constant. The charges, under the effect of electrostatic repulsion and the voltage gradient due to the current drain at the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}, start to move along the membrane\textquotesingle{}s surface, forming a macroscopic slow current. Given that the electrostatic interaction is very strong, we may assume that the neuronal membrane is equipotential, except the region immediately in front of the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} where the current drain works. The charges \textquotesingle{}created\textquotesingle{} at different distances from the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} need different times to arrive.\doxysubsection{Electrical modeling of neuronal membrane}\label{group__MODELING__ABSTRACT__MEMBRANE_MODELING_NEURONAL_MEMBRANE}
\doxyref{electric oscillator}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR_PHYSICS_MEASURING_OSCILLATOR}

For electrical modeling, we can use the approximation that a distributed condenser (the neuronal membrane) and a discrete resistor (the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}) form an $RC$ circuit. It is clear that all currents (including the synaptic currents, the membrane\textquotesingle{}s rush-\/in current, and the artificial currents either patching them directly to the membrane or clamping them to its axons) flow into the condenser (and cause potential increases calculated using membrane\textquotesingle{}s capacitance), furthermore the potential drops only due to the current flowing through the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}. It is the exact equivalent of {\texttt{ a passive RC {\bfseries{differentiator}} circuit}}\+: \char`\"{}the input is connected to a capacitor while the output voltage is taken from across a resistance\char`\"{} and not to be mismatched with {\texttt{ a passive RC {\bfseries{integrator}} circuit}} where \char`\"{}the input is connected to a resistance while the output voltage is taken from across a capacitor\char`\"{}.

We must not mismatch voltages on the input and output sides of the $RC$ circuit, furthermore we must be aware of the the basic electric entities on the two sides of the $RC$ circuit are not any more in connection that Ohm\textquotesingle{}s Law prediscts. Eq. $\eqref{eq:RC_Differentiator}$ shows that the {\itshape output voltage} is formed by differentiating the {\itshape input voltage}. Similarly, the currents on the two sides are different\+: the difference is stored in the form of \doxyref{slowly moving current}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT_PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT}. As we discussed, the \doxyref{the finite speed}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__SPEEDS_PHYSICS_SPEEDS_FINITE} modifies the interpretation of the conservation laws; Kichoff\textquotesingle{}s Law is valid only in its differential form. The charge conservation remains valid, but only in a broader sense; an important consequence of the non-\/instant interaction speed plus the finite size distributed capacitance.

According to eq. $\eqref{eq:RC_Differentiator}$, when working with the \textquotesingle{}native\textquotesingle{} inputs of the neuron, one needs to work with the {\itshape time derivative of the input voltage they cause in the membrane}. The input voltage $V_{IN}$ comprises different contributors, and the differentiation is linear; i.\+e., we shall sum up the different $\frac{dV}{dt}$ terms linearly. \begin{equation} V_{out}(t) = RC \sum \frac{dV_{IN}}{dt} \label{eq:OutputMembraneVoltage} \end{equation}

To describe the \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP}, the output voltage of the $RC$ circuit, we need to provide all contributions $\frac{dV}{dt}$ and solve the differential equation numerically. Because of the presence of slow currents, the membrane potential $V(x,t)$ depends on both location and time, we confine our discussion to the infintesimal thin region immediately in front of \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}, in this way reducing the voltage function to $V_{AIS}(t)$. We have a voltage contribution

\begin{equation} \frac{d}{dt}(V_M-V_{Rest}) \end{equation} due to the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS},

We know that In the case of a simple {\itshape differentiator} $RC$ circuit, the capacitor current of the membrane with capacity $C$ is expressed as \begin{equation} I_C=\frac{dQ}{dt}=C\frac{dV_{IN}}{dt}\label{eq:CapacitorCurrent} \end{equation} given that the voltage is the usual primary quantity. In biology, sometimes it is more practical to express the same relation with the component currents in a reversed way \begin{equation} \frac{dV_{IN}}{dt}(t) = \frac{I_C(t)}{C} \label{eq:MembraneVoltage} \end{equation} Anyhow, the input currents produce a voltage time derivate independently as described by $\eqref{eq:RC_Differentiator}$, and their effect (the increase in the value of $V_{OUT}$ as calculated from Eq. $\eqref{eq:DifferentiatorEquation}$) sum up linearly. Of course, the voltage change of different input currents (including the ones due to membrane\textquotesingle{}s charge-\/up, synaptic inputs and \textquotesingle{}artificial currents\textquotesingle{}) contribute independently. The resulting currents $I_C$ are summed, and on the output resistance $I_R$ create an output voltage

However, their time course is different\+: the slow currents need different travel time and the different contributions have different time distributions. In the case of biology, the gating mechanisms complicate the process The membrane charge-\/up starts only when the membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage is above the membrane\textquotesingle{}s threshold voltage, and conversely, the synaptic inputs are active only when the membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage is below the membrane\textquotesingle{}s threshold voltage, The patching and clamping contributions have external control. The resulting output voltage measurable on the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} simply comprises the sum of all those contributions. The time derivatives of the different voltages can be calculated using different physical models.

The membrane is considered as infinitesimally small (\char`\"{}point-\/like\char`\"{}) equipotential insulator piece surface, and its operation is thought to be closely aligned with that of an electric {\itshape RC} circuit. That model needs introducing fake physical and enzimatical mechanisms as well as defining mathematical relations between independently operating biological components.

Unlike that model, our abstract model considers the correct behavior of different interactions operating those abstract components, and can explain the operation of a neuron from the first principles. Among others, that controling the ion channels in membranes\textquotesingle{}s wall, inhibiting its synaptic inputs in well-\/defined phases of creating an action potential, emitting an \doxyref{action potential}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP_MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL} \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP} with its precise shape and timing, are a natural consequence of receiving finite-\/speed currents by a finite-\/size neuronal membrane. {\texttt{ Neuronal dynamics}}

For the sake of the discussion in this section (explaining semi-\/quantitatively {\itshape how} and {\itshape why} \doxyref{action potential}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP_MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL} is created) we assume the neuron\textquotesingle{}s membrane as a long, narrow and thin rectangular isolating surface with controlled ion channels in its wall, junctions at different points for controlled synaptic current inputs, furthermore a specific point for output current/voltage, the Axon Initial Segment (\doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}). The current flowing on the membrane comprises ions, which represent a kind of \doxyref{slow current}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT_PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT}. On the surface of the isolating membrane the electric processes attempt to maintain equal potentials. The \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} represents a permanent (but voltage-\/dependent) drain current $ I_{AIS}$, the synaptic inputs $ I_{SYN,i}$ contribute (time-\/dependent and gated) continuous input currents; with a characteristic time comparable to that of the characteristic time of the action pontential. Furthermore, there is a step-\/function-\/like contribution due to the ions rushing into the intracellular space when the ion channels in membrane\textquotesingle{}s wall open at reaching the threshold voltage. In experimental investigations, a clamping voltage $ I_{CLAMP}$ is switched to an axon (acts as a \doxyref{current generator}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON_MODELING_SINGLE_AXON}, despite that it is intended to be a voltage generator) or $ I_{DIRECT}$ current is introduced directly into the cell.

The \char`\"{}leaking current\char`\"{} $ I_{AIS}$ is active all the time. It is proportional to the difference of the {\itshape potential at \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} above the resting potential}, and the ion channels in \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} can be characterized by a discrete $R$ resistance value. The synaptic inputs $ I_{SYN,i}$ are active only in the charge-\/up and relative refractory period (actually, when {\itshape the membrane potential is below the threshold value}\+: otherwise the ions cannot enter the intracellular space against the higher membrane potential)

Because the ions (implementing the membrane current) are slow, the potential they create changes continuously, in the function of location and time. The \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP} is forwarded through the axon using the voltage immediately in front of the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}. This means that to derive the time course of the action potential, we need to consider the infinitesimal segment immediately in front of \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}, and to take into account that the slow current reaches that place under finite period. That is, we must consider both $\eqref{eq:Kirchoff_biology}$ and $\eqref{eq:Kirchoffs_differential}$

\begin{equation} C\frac{dV}{dt}+\frac{V(t,x)-V_{rest}}{R}+I_{MEMB}(t)+I_{SYN,i}(t)+I_{CLAMP}(t)+I_{DIRECT}(t) =0 \label{eq:Kirchoffscomplete} \end{equation}

The last two items are \char`\"{}foreign\char`\"{} contributions. In the simple case when after reaching the threshold potential ions rush in the intracellular space, , and the membrane current can be described as follows.

The ions rushing in the intracellular space, on the entire surface of the membrane, actually pass the ion channel with their thermal speed (in our approach\+: instantly) and they quickly reach a saturation level, meaning that both the voltage and the current that can flow away will be saturated, with a short time constant\+: the inflow is extremely quick and the ions shall diffuse to a small distance in the vicinity of the exit of the ion channel. That elevated membrane potential is connected to the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} (represented as resistance $R$, and a current can start. However, only the ions in the infinitesimal segment immediately in front of the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} can pass its ion channels, so the ions farther from \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} first have to reach that infinitesimal segment, that takes time. These two processes happen at the same time, so the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} will see the resulting current

\begin{equation} I_{MEMB}(t,x) = (1-\exp(-a*t))*exp(-b*t) \label{eq:MembraneCurrent} \end{equation}

For the simple case when the threshold potential have been reached, the synaptic inputs get blocked and no \char`\"{}foreign\char`\"{} current is present, Kirchoff\textquotesingle{}s Junction Law can be described as

\begin{equation} C\frac{dV}{dt}+\frac{V(t,x)-V_{rest}}{R}+I_{MEMB}(t,x) =0 \label{eq:Kirchoffspartial} \end{equation}

where $C$ is the capacity that can be interpreted for the system, see also \doxyref{how the classic physics imitates slow current}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT_PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT}.

The \textquotesingle{}artificial\textquotesingle{} inputs (patching and clamping) mostly add a constant current, that produces a zero time derivate on the membrane and result in a constant output voltage. Given that the amount of current through the current drain is limited by the resistivity $R$ of \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}, and it depends on the actual membrane voltage, introducing too high currents may lead to unnatural effects. If the external current integrated for a neuronal operating cycle exceeds the similary integrated maximum current the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} can transmit, the neuron \char`\"{}overflows\char`\"{}\+: the extra charge leaves to the extracellular space and the neuronal cyle stops working. Any external current moves the work point where the \textquotesingle{}native\textquotesingle{} inputs get effective again and the neuron can enter the \textquotesingle{}Refractory\textquotesingle{} phase; after some point the neuron stops emitting \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP}s.

(Notice in Figure \doxyref{fig\+\_\+\+Neuron\+Electric\+Operation\+Summary}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE_fig_NeuronElectricOperationSummary} that although the \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP} with its hyperpolarization arrives to the synapse, the \doxyref{PSP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_PSP} is not hyperpolarized.)

The membrane\textquotesingle{}s potential around the threshold value acts as a dual-\/circuit switch\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When \textquotesingle{}artificial currents\textquotesingle{} (or too frequent incoming spikes) increase membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage permanently to be around the threshold level, the ion channels in membrane\textquotesingle{}s wall will be in ill-\/defined state. Being very close to the threshold, small transients of the membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage may cause apparently unexpected
