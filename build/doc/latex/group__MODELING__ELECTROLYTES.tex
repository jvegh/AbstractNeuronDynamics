Cellular electrodiffusion phenomena are very complex, and it is a complex task to choose which physical/chemical effects can be omitted so that their omission does not prevent explaining physiological phenomena. We focus mainly on the commonly used fundamental omission that the \doxyref{speed of ionic movement}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT_PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT} cannot play a role in describing neuronal operations. Still, we must also discuss other (related) fallacies, such as that \doxyref{conductance }{p.}{group__MEASURING__CONDUCTANCE_MEASURING_CONDUCTANCE} is a primary electric entity or that the structured biological objects behave as metals do under the effect of electric forces.

\doxyref{Axons}{p.}{group__MODELING__AXON_MODELING_AXON} not only passively follow the potential\textquotesingle{}s time course, but they mediate the changes in their intracellular volume by using an ion pool available in their extracellular volume. A \char`\"{}longitudinal current\char`\"{} (forwarding charged particles in the direction of the apparent current) decays exponentially, so biology uses different methods for transferring information using charged particle carriers. Using \char`\"{}transversal current\char`\"{} (perpendicular to the apparent charge transfer on the surface of a membrane or inside an axon tube) or \char`\"{}circular current\char`\"{} (repolarization inside the Ranvier cells) enables transferring charge to large distances.

Despite this, biology extensively uses the \char`\"{}telegrapher\textquotesingle{}s equation\char`\"{} that assumes longitudinal current. Eq.$\sim$(2.\+8) in \cite{KochBiophysics:1999} mistakenly assumes that the axon is a passive cable with specific resistance; furthermore, that it necessarily contains movable charge carriers, and the current is not saturating as the voltage increases. Although the speed of the macroscopic current is in the dozens of m/s region for both a metallic wire and an axonal tube, the underlying mechanisms are different. Telegrapher\textquotesingle{}s equations can describe the passive metallic wire, but only Stokes\textquotesingle{}s Law can describe an active neuronal cable provided the effect of its active wall added; see section \doxyref{Axonal-\/charge-\/delivery}{p.}{group__MODELING__AXON_AXONAL_CHARGE_DELIVERY}.
