Axons not only passively follow the potential\textquotesingle{}s time course, but they mediate the changes in their internal volume by using an ion pool available in their extracellular volume. In their \textquotesingle{}natural regime\textquotesingle{}, they forward ion packages with pumping ions in and out, using that the ion channels in their wall have a \textquotesingle{}deactived\textquotesingle{} phase as well. In their \textquotesingle{}artificial\textquotesingle{} regime, the biological operating mode is drastically different.\doxysubsubsection{Modeling clamping}\label{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON_MODELING_SINGLE_AXON_CLAMPING}
The axon is modeled as a long electrolyte tube comprising cylindrical layers of thickness $dx$ along its axes, and we apply an external potential $V_{clamp}$ to the end of the tube. The little thin cylinders deliver ions of a specific chemical nature with an electrical charge.

In this model, we assume that during the time $dt$ in the volume $dx$, we have a constant ion inflow $I_{wall}$ through the axon\textquotesingle{}s wall, which increases the charge and concentration already in the volume. The charges in the tube experience an electric field $\frac{dV}{dx}$, and they move with a \doxyref{field-\/dependent speed}{p.}{group__MEASURING__CURRENT_MEASURING_CURRENT} $v$ inside the tube. As discussed, the axonal current appears in the volume $dx$ with a delay depending on $v$. The ionic fluid with velocity $v$ (proportional to $\frac{dV}{dx}$), in $dt$ time, transfers the ionic charge in the volume to the neighboring element at a distance $v*dt$, and delivers the charge from the neighboring element at a distance $-v*dt$ into this element. At time $t$, the concentration at $x$ will result from of the inflow at place $x-v*t$. The higher is $v$, the more is the difference between the \char`\"{}inflow\char`\"{} and the \char`\"{}present\char`\"{} concentration. The stream inside the axon, \doxyref{a la Minkowski}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__SPATIOTEMPORAL_PHYSICS_SPATIOTEMPORAL}, for the biological observation see also \cite{SpatiotemporalPlenz:1996} and \cite{CoherentSpatioTemporal:2018}, transforms the distance to time and vice versa. Under the effect of clamping, chemical ions diffuse into the tube ( $\alpha$ is a timing constant of dimension $(1/time)$), and the current is decreased by the stream proportionally\+:

\begin{equation} \frac{dI_{axon}}{dt}=-\alpha*I_{axon};\ I_{axon}(t)\approx I_{wall}*(1-\exp(-\alpha*t))\label{eq:AxonalCurrentNoConc} \end{equation}

The applied potential opens ion channels in the axon\textquotesingle{}s wall. Under clamping conditions, the membrane, the clamping point on the axon, and the intracellular and extracellular fluid initially maintain their resting potential. A physically plausible assumption is that when suddenly an external potential (such as clamping) is applied to some point of the axon, an electric field $\frac{dV}{dx}\propto(V_{membrane}-V_{clamp})$ appears on the {\itshape outside surface} of the axon. The extracellular space with its high ion concentration $C_{k}^{ext}$ represents an `ion cloud'. When the clamping voltage is switched on, a `fast' current instantly delivers the potential along the {\itshape outer} surface of the axon. However, this is not the case (at least not in the initial moment) on the {\itshape inner} surface\+: {\itshape there is no charge that could change the potential}. The physical picture, that the clamping potential instantly appears at the end of the axon at the membrane, is valid only if charge carriers exist in the axon, i.\+e., if (apparently) they have an infinitely large propagation speed.

\textquotesingle{}The intracellular concentration at rest is around five orders of magnitude less than that in the extracellular space\textquotesingle{} \cite{KochBiophysics:1999}. The clamping voltage immediately triggers the opening of ion channels in the axon\textquotesingle{}s wall, leading to a continuous increase in ion concentration over time. There is a continuous inflow through the axon\textquotesingle{}s wall from the extracellular space along the axon into the intracellular space as a \doxyref{\textquotesingle{}fast current\textquotesingle{}}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__ION__CHANNEL_MODELING_ION_CHANNEL}, see also the discussion in sections \doxyref{Ion channel}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__ION__CHANNEL_MODELING_ION_CHANNEL} and \doxyref{Modeling membrane}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__MEMBRANE_MODELING_SINGLE_MEMBRANE}. We consider the external concentration as constant\+: the extracellular space is infinitely large, and its concentration remains by orders of magnitude higher than the internal one.

The ions entering the intracellular space remain inside the axon (as discussed in section 11.\+4 of \cite{KochBiophysics:1999}, \textquotesingle{}once calcium enters the intracellular cytoplasm it is not free to diffuse\textquotesingle{}). The ions experience the electric field (which is present initially only at the clamping point), speed up, and (after a while) the \doxyref{ion\textquotesingle{}s speed becomes constant}{p.}{group__MEASURING__CURRENT_MEASURING_CURRENT} in time but depends on the actual electric field. The ions will slowly move along the axon {\itshape with a field-\/dependent constant velocity in the electric field} in a viscous solution. \textquotesingle{}In axon fibers, the effective diffusion constant was estimated to be about one-\/tenth of the diffusion coefficient in aqueous solution\textquotesingle{} \cite{KochBiophysics:1999}; they form a \textquotesingle{}slow current\textquotesingle{} (although mis-\/identified as electrodiffusion). The moving ions deliver charge, so the potential gradually extends along the electrolyte tube (the axon). {\itshape The current and the potential are not instant, as we consider in the classic theory of electricity}\+: they propagate with the speed of the ion current. Hodgkin and Huxley \cite{HodgkinHuxley:1952} were thinking in the Newtonian way; that is, they assumed that the transport speed of electrodiffusion in an axon and the propagation of electromagnetic field were the same, so {\itshape the slowly moving charged object that they observed could not be a current}. They expected the current to appear promptly after switching the clamping voltage on.

Under the impact of clamping, the outside field opens the ion channels in the axon\textquotesingle{}s wall, and ions enter the intracellular fluid. The ions will diffuse toward the axis of the tube. The ion layer, formed on the tube\textquotesingle{}s internal surface due to the charge arrived through the ion channels (or at least part of it), is removed by the macroscopic ion current, enabling a continuous ion inflow (a macroscopic current, as seen in \cite{HodgkinHuxley:1952}). In this way, the conditions of transferring ions through the channels persist, so they remain open (or periodically re-\/open \cite{MolecularBiology:2002} and -- in a statistical sense -- provide a permanent inflow current). Initially, the intracellular charge carrier concentration is very shallow\+: there is no initial current in the axon.

The clamping voltage combined with the repulsive force of the entered ions generates a field that generates a macroscopic ion current (the result of the numeric simulation of the process is depicted in Figs. \doxyref{fig\+\_\+\+HH\+\_\+\+Clamping\+\_\+\+ON}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON_fig_HH_Clamping_ON} and \doxyref{fig\+\_\+\+HH\+\_\+\+Clamping\+\_\+\+ON}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON_fig_HH_Clamping_ON}). At the beginning, the intracellular solution remains at the resting potential, and the clamping potential at the end \textquotesingle{}pushes\textquotesingle{} the ions toward the membrane, and in return, the ion\textquotesingle{}s potential raises the axon\textquotesingle{}s local potential. The diffused-\/in ions are transported towards the membrane as a \textquotesingle{}slow\textquotesingle{} macroscopic ionic current (the speed of current Hodgkin and Huxley \cite{HodgkinHuxley:1952} measured and also theoretically derived to be about $20$ $m/s$; it is in the order of magnitude we mentioned for the speed of macroscopic currents in metals and electrolytes).

\doxysubsubsection{Gating the axonal current}\label{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON_MODELING_SINGLE_AXON_GATING}
The ions suffer a \textquotesingle{}downhill\textquotesingle{} transfer from the axonal arbor \cite{NeuritsArbor:2022} to the membrane; that is, they can enter the membrane only if the potential in the arbor is above that in the membrane. Given that the membrane\textquotesingle{}s potential changes in the range $100\ mV$, and the threshold value is about $20\ mV$, the changing membrane\textquotesingle{}s potential provides a \textquotesingle{}gating\textquotesingle{} function with its \textquotesingle{}above the threshold\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}below the threshold\textquotesingle{} values. As experimentally experienced, {\itshape while the membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage is above the membrane\textquotesingle{}s threshold value, the ions from the axon cannot enter the membrane}.

When the rushing-\/in begins, the collected charge will not change any more (its value is remembered by the {\itshape time} when rush-\/in begins), and so will their charge collection time\+: the computational result is ready. The ions need to propagate against membrane\textquotesingle{}s electric repulsion and they cannot enter the membrane anymore until its potential decreases below the threshold level again (this period is known as the \textquotesingle{}absolute refractory\textquotesingle{} period); the rest of the spike remains in \textquotesingle{}pending\textquotesingle{} state. The speed of the ion current between the arbor and the membrane is proportional to their potential difference.

Experimental evidence shows that the effect of new synaptic inputs, arriving after the rush-\/in current stops, is the weaker the closer is the time of their arrival to closing the gate. In other words, according to our model\+: the intensity of the current contribution is proportional to the difference of the threshold potential and the actual membrane potential. In the \textquotesingle{}falling edge\textquotesingle{} phase, that difference is the larger the later the new spike arrives. With using the notion of \textquotesingle{}slow current\textquotesingle{}, we can also interpret why they seem to arrive much later compared to the time when the membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage drops below the threshold value\+: the \textquotesingle{}slow\textquotesingle{} current must travel from its dendritic entry point to the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}. This delay leads to the fallacy of \textquotesingle{}relative refractory\textquotesingle{} period\+: only \textquotesingle{}refractory\textquotesingle{} period exists. The \textquotesingle{}delayed\textquotesingle{} current may appear at the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} at the time when the membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage is about the \textquotesingle{}hyperpolarized\textquotesingle{} state. In general, the neuron has a spatiotemporal behavior. The measured time course has a sense only when the position of the measurement is also known, and especially, the {\itshape time difference} between event matters.

The ion rush-\/in into the membrane continues for a while, and the membrane\textquotesingle{}s potential increases. The increasing potential drives a current through the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} that decrases membrane\textquotesingle{}s potential (because of the finite speed of ions, they appear with a delay both on the mebrane and on the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}). At the point when membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage drops below the threshold, the synaptic inputs can contribute again\+: the neuron is in phase \textquotesingle{}Relaxing\textquotesingle{} again. This period is mistakenly identied as \textquotesingle{}relative refractory\textquotesingle{} period. Actually, this state is not a \textquotesingle{}refractory\textquotesingle{}; it is \textquotesingle{}Relaxing\textquotesingle{} starting with an elevated membrane potential. It begins earlier than the first output appears on the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}. The slow axonal currents from the re-\/opened arbors must reach \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}, so they appear there with a delay (from different distances at different times), creating the {\itshape illusion that inputs are re-\/enabled only when the membrane voltage is about its hyperpolarized voltage value} \cite{NeuralDynamicsGertsner:2014}. Given that the neuron is actually in a \textquotesingle{}Relaxing\textquotesingle{} state, -- due to re-\/opening the axonal inputs -- the pending inputs can contribute again, this time to the \textquotesingle{}next\textquotesingle{} spike. In this period the neuronal potential differs from its resting value\+: it implements a short-\/term (time-\/dependent) {\itshape neuronal memory}; see Figure \doxyref{fig\+\_\+\+AP\+\_\+\+Conceptual}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP_fig_AP_Conceptual}. The pending contribution is the larger the closer was the time of closing the arboral gates to the arrival of the synaptic input; a plausible explanation of Hebb\textquotesingle{}s observation.

With introducing the idea of \textquotesingle{}slow current\textquotesingle{}, we arrive at a clear interpretation of the observed refractory period. The synaptic inputs are closed when membrane\textquotesingle{}s potential is above the threshold potential, and they are open below that value. This distinction may be important in the presence of \textquotesingle{}artificial\textquotesingle{} currents (clamping and patching)\+: the current adds a potential offset to the voltage level; furthermore, the patching current may arrive through a \textquotesingle{}valved\textquotesingle{} axon. If that offset becomes higher than the threshold, no synaptic input can be received. Actually, the refractory period reflects an \textquotesingle{}all or nothing\textquotesingle{} feature of the synaptic inputs\+: they are either open or closed, without a third state; unlike the ion channels.\doxysubsection{Axonal-\/charge-\/delivery}\label{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON_AXONAL_CHARGE_DELIVERY}
Clamping sets up an artificial working regime for the ion channels\+: the permanent electric field on the outer surface keeps the ion channels open (in a stationary state) and enables ions to enter the inner surface where formerly no ions (and no potential) existed. The rushed-\/in ions will flow away from the place of clamping, and a slow current toward the membrane can start. As discussed in section \doxyref{The true membrane current}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__MEMBRANE_MODELING_SINGLE_MEMBRANE_TRUE_CURRENT}, when the membrane\textquotesingle{}s potential reaches its threshold potential, after a similar rush-\/in over the membrane\textquotesingle{}s surface, the ions can only leave through the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}.\doxysubsubsection{Evaluation method matters}\label{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON_AXONAL_CHARGE_EVALUATION}
It is a common fallacy that choosing the model and the data evaluation method do not influence the conclusions. Hodgkin and Huxley in their classic work \cite{HodgkinHuxley:1952} also showed that using a \textquotesingle{}model-\/free\textquotesingle{} data evaluation method leads to conclusions opposite with the ones derived using the right physical model, from the same experimental data.

Their Figure 3 (reproduced in Figure \doxyref{fig\+\_\+\+Fitting\+Experimental\+Data}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON_fig_FittingExperimentalData}) shows the result of the evaluation of their experimental data. Unfortunately, they used their Eq. (11) to fit the data. I.\+e., once they introduced the wrong hypothesis that a $K^+$ ion current is present during the process (without proof, or despite the proof published in their former paper \cite{HodgkinHuxleyCurrentVoltage:1952}), used the \doxyref{wrong interpretation of conductance}{p.}{group__MEASURING__CONDUCTANCE_MEASURING_CONDUCTANCE}, then topped the evaluating process with using an ad-\/hoc polynomial expression that adds a \textquotesingle{}no current\textquotesingle{} region to the \textquotesingle{}exponential current\textquotesingle{} region. This exponential increase following a \textquotesingle{}no current\textquotesingle{} region (a sudden exponential increase in membrane\textquotesingle{}s current) has been measured with high precision by \cite{SodiumCurrentDelay:2006}. As expressed by HH, \textquotesingle{}there is reasonable agreement between theoretical and experimental curves, except that {\itshape the latter show more initial delay}\textquotesingle{}. What was not noticed by HH (due to the lack of physical picture) was, as seen in the figure, that {\itshape the initial delay is the longer the lower is the clamping voltage}. In this way, the proportion of these two regions changes with the speed of the ion current, so their numeric values depicted in their Table 1, are completely wrong.

\end{figure}


If we use the correct physical picture (that is, that the speed of the ion current is proportional to the clamping voltage), we can display the amplitude of the measured current and time constant in function of the clamping voltage, see Fig. \doxyref{fig\+\_\+\+Speed\+Dependence}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON_fig_SpeedDependence}. Both the wrong (ad-\/hoc) values from HH\textquotesingle{}s Table 1 and the values derived from our physics-\/based model are shown. Our model-\/based fitting results (as displayed in Figure \doxyref{fig\+\_\+\+Fitting\+Experimental\+Data}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON_fig_FittingExperimentalData}) show a linear dependence (although \doxyref{the accuracy of those values gets worse as the clamping current decreases}{p.}{group__MEASURING__CONDUCTANCE_MEASURING_CONDUCTANCE}), while those of HH show opposite tendency, due to the voltage-\/dependent delay. (Notice that HH named the measured quantity as conductance although actually it is a current.)

We assume that the ionic inflow does not affect significantly the internal concentration and that the external concentration is constant. The saturation current depends on the speed of ions (i.\+e., on the clamping voltage, see Fig. \doxyref{fig\+\_\+\+Fitting\+Experimental\+Data}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON_fig_FittingExperimentalData} and Fig. \doxyref{fig\+\_\+\+Speed\+Dependence}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON_fig_SpeedDependence}) in the tube. Our simple model assumes that $\alpha$ is constant in time but (through $v$ and $\frac{dV}{dx}$) depends on the clamping voltage.

We have a constant voltage at the end of the tube; a \textquotesingle{}slow\textquotesingle{} current \textquotesingle{}flowing out\textquotesingle{} from the tube increases and appears on the membrane, {\itshape establishing the illusion that the conductance of the tube and/or membrane increases}. {\itshape Resistance/conductance cannot be interpreted when charge carriers flow into the resistor} (and this is the case with the axon) from the environment\+: the \textquotesingle{}slow\textquotesingle{} current produces a different behavior (increases the number of charge carriers $n$).\doxysubsubsection{The Post-\/\+Synaptic Potential}\label{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON_MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_PSP}
Some schematic figures (for example the one {\texttt{ showing signal transmission from a presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic neuron}}) miss the point that at the synapse the action potential appears as a different shape, furthermore mis-\/identifies the temporal length of \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP} to essentially between the beginning of charge-\/up to the end of reaching the hyperpolarization peak voltage. (Notice in Figure \doxyref{fig\+\_\+\+Neuron\+Electric\+Operation\+Summary}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE_fig_NeuronElectricOperationSummary} that although the \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP} with its hyperpolarization arrives to the synapse, the \doxyref{PSP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_PSP} is not hyperpolarized.) Our discussion shows that {\itshape the long tail after hyperpolarization is a vital part of \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP}} (amond others, provides short-\/term neuronal memory for neuronal cooperation).

\end{figure}


As the figure about {\texttt{ signal transmission from a presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic neuron}} depicts, the arriving presynaptic charge packages sum up and correspondingly produce a signal that corresponds to the spatially and temporally summed voltage change on the axon.

The textbook \cite{MolecularBiology:2002} mistakenly attributes the role of encoding the magnitude of \doxyref{PSP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_PSP} to the ion channels (today known as \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}). \textquotesingle{}For long-\/distance transmission, the magnitude of the \doxyref{PSP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_PSP} is therefore translated, or encoded, into the frequency of firing of action potentials. This encoding is achieved by a special set of gated ion channels that are present at high density at the base of the axon.\textquotesingle{} The \doxyref{encoding}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP_MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL} is performed by the interplay of neuron\textquotesingle{}s finite size and the finite speed of the ion current, furthermore it is only indirectly connected to the firing rate. The fact that the amplitudes are summed spatially and temporally, demonstrates the \doxyref{spatiotemporal behavior}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__SPATIOTEMPORAL_PHYSICS_SPATIOTEMPORAL}.

The \textquotesingle{}artificial\textquotesingle{} inputs (patching and clamping) mostly add a constant current, that produces a zero time derivate on the membrane and results in a constant output voltage. Given that the amount of current through the current drain is limited by the resistivity $R$ of \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}, and it depends on the actual membrane voltage, introducing too high currents may lead to unnatural effects. If the external current integrated for a neuronal operating cycle exceeds the similary integrated maximum current the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} can transmit, the neuron \char`\"{}overflows\char`\"{}\+: the extra charge leaves to the extracellular space and the neuronal cycle stops working. Any external current moves the work point where the \textquotesingle{}native\textquotesingle{} inputs get effective again and the neuron can enter the \textquotesingle{}Refractory\textquotesingle{} phase; after some point the neuron stops emitting \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP}s. The axons are closed in the \textquotesingle{}Delivering\textquotesingle{} stage, so the axonal inputs are not effective, given that thair gatings are closed. When \textquotesingle{}artificial currents\textquotesingle{} (or too frequent incoming spikes) increase membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage permanently to be around the threshold level, the ion channels in membrane\textquotesingle{}s wall will be in ill-\/defined state. Being very close to the threshold, small transients of the membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage may cause apparently unexpected changes in the output voltage, because their {\itshape time derivative} matters.

HH measured also the experimental response function of the neuron to switching a clamping voltage ON and OFF, with the result displayed in Figure \doxyref{Hodgkin\+Huxley\+Step\+Function}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON_HodgkinHuxleyStepFunction}. As they commented\+: \textquotesingle{}both sodium and potassium conductances increase with a delay when the axon is depolarized but fall with no appreciable inflexion when it is repolarized\textquotesingle{} \cite{HodgkinHuxley:1952}. If our physical model\+: when switching clamping ON, there are no charge carriers in the axonal tube; they must be \textquotesingle{}produced\textquotesingle{} first, as our model describes the time course of the axonal current. The current (after some delay caused by the electrolyte electrodes; a speed-\/dependent effect) exponentially decreases towards its saturation value. When switching clamping OFF, the tube is full with charge carriers, and the discharging starts with a delay.
