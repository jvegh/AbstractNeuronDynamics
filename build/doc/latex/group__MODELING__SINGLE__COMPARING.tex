The infinitely sophisticated operation forces us to analyze the components, their operation, their interface and cooperation individually, case by case.

{\texttt{ In formal models of spiking neurons the shape of an action potential (dashed line) is usually replaced by a $\delta$ pulse (vertical line). The negative overshoot (spike-\/afterpotential) after the pulse is replaced by a ‘reset’ of the membrane potential to the value of resting potential. }} That is, formal models throw away neuronal memory and so neural cooperation, among others.

Because of its common acceptance and wide usage, we discuss the \doxyref{Hodkin-\/\+Huxley model}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__COMPARING_MODELING_SINGLE_HODGKIN_HUXLEY} in a separate section\doxysubsection{The Hodgkin-\/\+Huxley model}\label{group__MODELING__SINGLE__COMPARING_MODELING_SINGLE_HODGKIN_HUXLEY}
The {\texttt{ online book}} on neuronal dynamics provides a very thorough discussion of the famous Hodgkin-\/\+Huxley model \cite{HodgkinHuxley:1952}. This was the very first attempt to provide a science-\/based model for the \doxyref{electric operation of a neuron}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC_MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC}, and it was the first step on a {\itshape terra incognita}. Setting it up enormously advanced our understanding in the field and deserved the Nobel-\/prize. However, since the decades the knowledge base has significantly extended and at some points the model must be enhanced. Its simplified ideas served very well in understanding the basics, but to discuss the finer details, many of its statements and assumptions must be modified.

First, at that time the \doxyref{structure of neuronal mebrane}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC_ABSTRACT_ELECTRIC_NEURON} was not known. Due to the lack of knowing the role of the Axon Initial Segment (\doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}), they assumed the wrong type of the \doxyref{neuronal oscillator}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR_PHYSICS_MEASURING_OSCILLATOR}, and from that point on, many critical points of their discussion concerning the \doxyref{electric operation}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC_MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC} must be extended, enhanced and fixed. Second, they had the point-\/like neurons in mind and did not consider that biology operates using \doxyref{slow currents}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT_PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT}. These two concepts must be extended/changed to enable how and why the \doxyref{Action Potential}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP_MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL} is evoked.

Here we confine the discussion to some general aspects, details are provided throughout the different section of the site.
