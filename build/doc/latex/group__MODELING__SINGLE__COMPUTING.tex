There are strong arguments behind hypothesizing that {\itshape neural computing operations (processing, transferring, and storing information) are closely related to the time course of the nervous system\textquotesingle{}s ionic currents} (both presynaptic currents and spiking).

The goal was set \cite{SejnowskiComputationalNeuroscience:1988} decades ago\+: "{}The ultimate aim of computational neuroscience is to explain how electrical and chemical signals are used in the brain to represent and process information"{}. Since then, chemical and enzymatic research has advanced a lot. However, explaining the electrical signals, primarily how the brain uses them to represent and process information, has stalled, mainly because of using wrong approximations of biological reality. Biology uses ad-\/hoc mathematical models (typically lacking physical reality) outside of their range of validity, and they deliver inconsistent, self-\/contradicting predictions, expectations, and interpretations for the real neurons and their networks. No place remains for interpreting the brain\textquotesingle{}s neural information processing as a collective activity of neurons. Furthermore, we cannot discover that the brain handles information differently \cite{VeghNeuralShannon:2022}.
