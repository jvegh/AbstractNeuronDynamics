\textquotesingle{}The function of ion channels is to allow specific inorganic ions to diffuse rapidly down their electrochemical gradients across the lipid bilayer... Nerve cells (neurons), in particular, have made a specialty of using ion channels, and ... use a diversity of such channels for receiving, conducting, and transmitting signals... Ion hannels cannot be coupled to an energy source to perform active transport, so the transport that they mediate is always passive (“downhill”)\textquotesingle{}.\cite{MolecularBiology:2002}

Recall that, in physics, the {\itshape drift speed} and the {\itshape thermal speed} of ions differ by several orders of magnitude ({\texttt{ as a consequence, \char`\"{}transport efficiency of ion channels\char`\"{}}} is $10^5$ times greater than the fastest rate of transport mediated by any known carrier protein) \cite{MolecularBiology:2002}. They are either closed or open without a noticeable transition state, but as discussed in \cite{ThreeStateUnidirectional:2004} \cite{MarkovianIonChannel:2005}, for their adequate description three states are needed\+: they can also be in inactivated state. We can consider the channel operation as \char`\"{}infinitely fast\char`\"{} compared to the speed of processes in front and behind of the channel\+: the massive difference in speeds explains why ion channel opening and closing resembles a \textquotesingle{}digital operating mode\textquotesingle{}. \doxyref{The different speeds}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__SPEEDS_PHYSICS_SPEEDS} we have discussed play a significant role in the correct operation and the cooperation of different neuronal objects, including ion channels in the walls of membranes and axons.

Experimental evidence shows that although {\texttt{ \textquotesingle{}the durations of channel opening and closing vary greatly, the rate at which current flows through an open channel is practically constant\textquotesingle{}}}. The presence of the two layers on the opposite sides of the membrane actually implements the control square-\/ware signal on the figure. Theose layers also explain why the ion channels (in a statistical sense) behave as digital, despite that the individual ion channels are not digital.

When, in an intracellular fluid, a voltage-\/controlled ion channel in the wall of membrane gets opened (for any reason), the ions in the immediate proximity of the entrance of the channel have a great chance (a sizeable solid angle) to occupy a new, less crowded space by using their high thermal speed. (from the other direction, the chance is about the same, but the concentration is at least five orders of magnitude less.) How much they can use the possibility, depends on the actual conditions, mainly concentrations and gradients.

When the ions pass the channel, they face two effects on the two sides of the membrane. On the side of departure with high concentration, they suddenly `empty' a thin layer in the immediate proximity of the membrane since the ions escape using their high thermal speed. Still, the ions in the next layer of the departure side can fill that thin `empty' space only with their low drift speed. On the side of arrival with low concentration, again, the arrived ions suddenly form a \textquotesingle{}filled\textquotesingle{} thin layer. However, following their arrival, they can use only their drift speed to populate the next thin neighboring layer. (BTW\+: this effect can be misinterpreted as a sudden ion adsorption \cite{Hodgkin-HuxleyAdsorption:2021} on the surface of the membrane.) The final effect resembles an electric condenser\+: for a short time, ion-\/rich and ion-\/poor layers are formed on the two sides of the semipermeable isolator membrane.

On the one side, the rapid influx of ions is halted, causing a sudden increase in potential on the intracellular side. The significant concentration difference \textquotesingle{}pushes\textquotesingle{} the ions into the intracellular space, where the potential on the inner side near to the membrane\textquotesingle{}s surface, that has suddenly increased, \textquotesingle{}pushes back\textquotesingle{} the ions. Conversely, the ions\textquotesingle{} removal from the layer on the extracellular side near the membrane \textquotesingle{}empties\textquotesingle{} the ions, and the after-\/diffusion (despite the large concentration difference) with the low drift speed takes time. Becasue of the slow after-\/diffusion, the transfer stops well before the ion channels get inactivated.

This behavior explains why ion currents start up with a sharp exponential rise \cite{SodiumCurrentDelay:2006} (fitting polynomial lines \cite{HodgkinHuxley:1952} to those critical regions was a big mistake\+: it hides the sudden change \cite{SodiumCurrentDelay:2006} caused by the state change (opening) of the ion channels, and that the \textquotesingle{}rising edge\textquotesingle{} is actually described by an exponential increase); why initiating an \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP} has precise timings (both the charge-\/up signal and pressing ions through the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}); why axonal arbors can provide a precise `Computing\+Begin' signal. For the details, see the following subsections. \doxyref{Measuring the conductance}{p.}{group__MEASURING__CONDUCTANCE_MEASURING_CONDUCTANCE} of ion channels, requires special care. It is easy to make a systematic error, given that the measurement device can affect the result.
