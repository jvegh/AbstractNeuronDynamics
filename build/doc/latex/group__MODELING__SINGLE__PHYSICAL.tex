Handling the several orders of magnitude in the relevant speeds of different physical phenomena (related to electric operations) needs great care. Using wrong approximations excludes, forever, recognizing that
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item neuron cell is not equipotential (it needs severe efforts to concert conductance with the many-\/compartment model)
\item creating an action potential is a native feature of non-\/equipotential cells
\item no mystic electric operation control mechanisms (such as changing conductance or synchronized currents) are built into neurons
\item the chemical nature and function of the different ion currents are drastically different from the one that is assumed today
\item understanding the temporal operation of the membrane is the key to understanding how the neural system computes
\item the neural information transfer is a collective effort and a distributed analog process
\item the representation of neural information is entirely different from the one that is commonly assumed
\item interfacing technical and biological computing needs different principles
\item neuromorphic computing needs new operating principles

Without external invasion (incoming spikes or experimenter\textquotesingle{}s current injection) the neuron remains in a stable (but dynamic) equilibrium state. The electric potential and concentration between the intracellular and extracellular regions on the two sides of its semipermeable membrane differ. On the intracellular side a negative resting potential is accompanied by low ion concentration. The ions arriving from the external world change that equilibrium state and the neuron attempts to restore that state, using different mechanisms. The neuron {\itshape passively} receives external charge (from fellow neurons or the experimenter) and {\itshape actively} receives and sends charge from its extracellular environment to compensate for its effect.

When the external invasion exceeds some tolerance level, the neuron autonomously takes measures to restore its resting state, maybe even at the price of overcompensating the external effect for some short time by borrowing ions from the extracellular space. The neuron attempts to restore its intracellular stationary state\+: removes the excess ions through its \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} to the extracellular space. The extracellular space represents an \textquotesingle{}infinite pool\textquotesingle{} of ions for the processes that need extra ions, so we discuss changes only on the intracellular side. (The ions are at the same time chemicals, but the concentration change they cause is negligible and is only local.)

Initially the neuron\textquotesingle{}s membrane potential has a resting value. In this stage, the gates for external currents (the synaptic terminals) are enabled\+: the neuron is ready to receive external charge in its {\itshape natural way}. When (due to the received external charges) the deviation from the resting potential exceeds a critical threshold level, the neuron disables receiving more input charge until the potential can be decreased again below the critical level.

The neuron wants to inform the fellow neurons (at the end of its axon) that its threshold level exceeded. To do so, it needs more charge for issuing an intense current pulse (spike). The neuron opens the ion channels in its membrane\textquotesingle{}s wall. Through those channels, ions from the extracellular space rush in, and their appearance increases the membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage.

The neuron can remove the excess charge only through its \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}, so ions start to flow out through the ion channels in the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}. The finite size (the path along the current from where the ions enter membrane to the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}) and their finite speed together results \doxyref{in the shape of the Action Potential}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP_MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL}.\doxysubsubsection{Conceptual stages of operation}\label{group__MODELING__SINGLE__PHYSICAL_MODELING_SINGLE_PHYSICAL_CONCEPTUAL}
Our assumptions on the operation of an abstract neuron for generating an \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP} are summarized in Figure \doxyref{fig\+\_\+\+AP\+\_\+\+Conceptual}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP_fig_AP_Conceptual}. As displayed, the operation proceeds from stage to stage as the time passes, where the time-\/ordered stages are distinguished by physically different mechanisms of charge handling. Initially, the potential of the neuronal membrane is at the value of the resting potential and the neuron is in stage \textquotesingle{}Relaxing\textquotesingle{}. When the first synaptic input arrives, the potential value gets higher and the neuron passes into stage \textquotesingle{}Computing\textquotesingle{}. Without experimenter\textquotesingle{}s invasion, this happens due to excitations arriving through neuron\textquotesingle{}s synapses. The subsequent neuronal inputs may increase membrane\textquotesingle{}s potential above the threshold level. Given that {\itshape the result of this neuronal operation is its charge integration time}, we call this stage \textquotesingle{}Computing\textquotesingle{}\+: how much time is required until the threshold voltage is reached. At that point, the result of \textquotesingle{}Computing\textquotesingle{} is ready and the neuron passes to stage \textquotesingle{}Delivering\textquotesingle{}\+: it prepares to transfer its result, \doxyref{the spike}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP_MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL}, to the downstream neuron(s) through its axon.

When entering \textquotesingle{}Delivering\textquotesingle{}, two simultaneous actions affecting the charge collection of the neuron take place. First, exceeding the threshold voltage opens the ion channels in its membrane\textquotesingle{}s wall, and second, the neuron closes its synaptic inputs (the elevated membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage prevents ions entering the membrane). The rushed-\/in ions through the membrane\textquotesingle{}s wall very quickly increase the amount of ions on the intracellular surface, and so the membrane\textquotesingle{}s voltage increases. The appearance of ions on the surface is instant, but it takes time (in the order of $0.1\ ms$) until the ions create a saturated layer on the surface. The details are discussed in section \doxyref{Modeling membrane}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__MEMBRANE_MODELING_SINGLE_MEMBRANE}. The presence of the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} represents a current drain that causes a potential gradient. The details are discussed in section \doxyref{Electric operation of neurons}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC_MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_OPERATION}. The ions entering the intracellular side near to the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} will flow out immediately after the ions rush in; the ions entering at a place farther from the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} need distance-\/dependent time (in the order of $0.5\ ms$) to reach the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}. The ions on the surface will move along the gradient, with their finite speed.

Until the ions traveling from the most distant point reach the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}, the current at the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} increases. In the inital phase of restoring the resting potential, the membrane \textquotesingle{}stores\textquotesingle{} the ions (they are on the surface, but they need time to reach the resistor). In the later period the \textquotesingle{}capacitive current\textquotesingle{} reverses and produces an overshot (hyperpolarization). The effect resembles an underdamped damping oscillation (with a damping ratio $\zeta\approx 0.3$).

When the decreasing membrane potential drops below the threshold value, the synaptic inputs get re-\/enabled\+: the neuron enters stage \textquotesingle{}Relaxing\textquotesingle{} again. At that point, the membrane potential is not yet restored. The next \doxyref{\textquotesingle{}neuronal computation\textquotesingle{}}{p.}{group__COMPUTING__BASICS_COMPUTING} may start from a potential above or below the resting potential\+: the neuronal membrane has a \textquotesingle{}memory\textquotesingle{} (the memory changes the next \textquotesingle{}computing time\textquotesingle{}). It is worth to notice that the slow synaptic current needs time (in the order of $0.1-0.5\ ms$) to travel from its entry point to the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS}, so they cause a voltage change at the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} at a time when the voltage due to the membrane current is about or after reaching the hyperpolarized state.
