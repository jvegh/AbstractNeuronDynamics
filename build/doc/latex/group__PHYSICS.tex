There is a common fallacy that physics cannot precisely underpin the operation of living matter. No doubt, however, that the basic notions and terms need to be interpreted precisely, much beyond the level we used to at college level, using the appropriate abstractions and approximations for the phenomena, depending on the level of abstraction needed in the given cooperation of objects and interactions. In this section we discuss some of the relevant terms and notions of physics, differentiating which approximation is appropriate for physics (mainly electronics) and which approximation is appropriate for physiology.

As we discuss, biophysics simply translated the major terminus technicus words the corresponding words from the theory and practice of physics\textquotesingle{} major subfileds, maily electricity, which was worked out for homogenous, isotropic, structureless metals; to the structured, non-\/homogeneous non-\/izotropic, material mixtures. Those notions not always have unchanged meaning, and how much they do, depends on the actual conditions. The precise meaning needs a case-\/by-\/case analysis.
