We give a short introduction to \doxyref{the ideas we use to describe }{p.}{group__PHYSICS__INTRODUCTORY_PHYSICS_Description} nature. To describe a {\itshape well defined} range of phenomena, we use approximations and omissions, and we create abstractions which can then be described by known Laws using the universal language of mathematics. For example, we use the abstraction \char`\"{}charge\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}charge carrier\char`\"{} for electrons, protons, ions, etc., and we can describe the electricity-\/related abstract features of the carriers. We must not forget, however, that those Laws have been derived for abstractions based on approximations and omissions, and so they also have their range of validity. To apply Laws from different fields of science, we must scrutinize whether all Laws we use are applied within their range of validity. Biology, and especially neuronal operations, produces examples where wrong omissions in the complex processes results in absolutely wrong results. In those cases some initial resemblance between our theoretical predictions and our phenomena exist, the success in simple cases provides no guarantee that the model was appropriate. Finally, all Laws are approximations and the accuracy of verifying their predictions is limited. Several theories can describe some phenomenon with the required accuracy. We also show in section \doxyref{about the finite interaction speeds}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__SPEEDS_PHYSICS_SPEEDS} that the mostly known Laws (from Newton, Coulomb, Kichoff, etc.) are also approximations. They have their range of validity, although it is often forgotten.

One such neuralgic points of omissions and approximations is \doxyref{the vastly different interaction speeds}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__SPEEDS_PHYSICS_SPEEDS_FINITE}; furthermore, that where the speed is considered at all, {\itshape the same speed is assumed for all interactions}. The Laws are abstract in the sense that, say, the objects in the Laws of physics have either mass or electric charge, but not both. It is the researcher\textquotesingle{}s task to decide which combination of Laws can be applied to the given condition. For example, one can assume in most cases that the speeds sum up linearly, except at very high speeds. Biology provides excellent case studies where different interactions shape the phenomenon and special care must be excercised. We give a short review of \doxyref{history and kinds of interaction speeds}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__SPEEDS_PHYSICS_SPEEDS}.

Neuronal operation is at the boundary where sometimes, in the same phenomenon, one interaction can be interpreted at macroscopic level, some another must already be interpreted at the microscopic level. Given the vital role if charge and current in neuronal operation, we give their precise interpretation.

Special emphasis is given to \doxyref{the true interpretation of conductance}{p.}{group__MEASURING__CONDUCTANCE_MEASURING_CONDUCTANCE}, one of the central terms in biology.
