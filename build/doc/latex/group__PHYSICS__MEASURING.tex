With the development of electronics (especially computing technology) and proliferation of special-\/purpose electronic devices, routine-\/like electronic measurements are carried out throughout all experimental science fields, including physiology. Routine-\/like activities always carry the danger that in a \textquotesingle{}hit-\/and-\/run\textquotesingle{} style measurement one makes mistakes and misinterpretations. \doxysubsection*{Modules}
