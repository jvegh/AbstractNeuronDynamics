In the some cases, when precisely measuring the time course of current compared to the time course of voltage, one can experience a \textquotesingle{}phase delay\textquotesingle{} between them. This may inspire further research, such as inventing \textquotesingle{}inductive\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}capacitive\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}resistive\textquotesingle{} current; or one may believe that the system shows \textquotesingle{}non-\/ohmic\textquotesingle{} behavior\+: it cannot be described by Laws of physics.\doxysubsection{Electric oscillator}\label{group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR_PHYSICS_MEASURING_OSCILLATOR}

The two circuits comprise the same electric components, but wired in a different way\+: they form a {\itshape serial} and a {\itshape parallel} circuit. The serial circuit is {\texttt{ a passive RC {\bfseries{differentiator}} circuit}}\+: \char`\"{}the input is connected to a capacitor while the output voltage is taken from across a resistance\char`\"{} and is not not to be mismatched with the parallel circuit where {\texttt{ a passive RC {\bfseries{integrator}} circuit}} where \char`\"{}the input is connected to a resistance while the output voltage is taken from across a capacitor\char`\"{}.

One of the most vital differences between those circuits (see also the figures in Table \doxyref{RCIntegrator\+Circuit}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR_RCIntegratorCircuit}) that their output is defined by the {\itshape time integral} of the input voltage (or current) or by its {\itshape time derivative}. From biological point of view, {\itshape the differentiator can produce output voltage that differs from the input voltage in its sign, while the integrator cannot}.

The integrator and differentiator are entirely different assemblies from the same components (based on the abstraction that $R$ and $C$ are discrete elements and the wiring is an ideal conductor), as their differential equations and waveforms show; see table \doxytableref{RC\+\_\+circuits}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR_RC_circuits}, from {\texttt{ the electric tutorial}}. Although they have the same time constant $RC$, they form the input signal entirely differently. From the figures showing the generated signal forms, one sees that the input signal\textquotesingle{}s rising edge generates a rising output voltage, and the falling edge generates a voltage with opposite sign compared to the input voltage, in resemblance with the action potential. With replacing the square wave with a physically plausible input voltage function, we have good hopes to reproduce the \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP} on the output of the circuit.

higher the input frequency the lower will be the output amplitude compared to that of the input.

The Differentiator is a High Pass Filter type of circuit that can convert a square wave input signal into high frequency spikes at its output (For non-\/square wave input, the spikes get smeared). When the capacitor is fully charged the output voltage across the resistor is zero. The arrival of the falling edge of the input waveform (whether square-\/ware or other type of falling edge) causes the capacitor to reverse charge giving a negative output spike, and the output spike changes from a positive value to a negative value.
