As emphasized many times, we construct Laws and conclusions on somewhat simplified abstractions. The notions and laws depend on the round of phenomena. The Newtonian and Einsteinian world is basically distinguished by considering speed dependence. Interesting consequences are that in the Einsteinian world, the mass is not constant, the time and space are not absolute, and so on. Here we scrutinize the basic notions and discover similar differences between physics and biology as consequences of the required different abstractions and approximations. \doxysubsection*{Modules}
