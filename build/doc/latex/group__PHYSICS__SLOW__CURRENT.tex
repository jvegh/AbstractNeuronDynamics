In the some cases, when precisely measuring the time course of current compared to the time course of voltage, one can experience a \textquotesingle{}phase delay\textquotesingle{} between them. This may inspire further research, such as inventing \textquotesingle{}inductive\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}capacitive\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}resistive\textquotesingle{} currents; or, in biology, one may believe that the system shows \textquotesingle{}non-\/ohmic\textquotesingle{} behavior\+: it cannot be described by Laws of physics. However, it was not the case.\doxysubsection{Currents with different speed}\label{group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT_PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT}
There may be different reasons why apparently a \doxyref{current}{p.}{group__MEASURING__CURRENT_MEASURING_CURRENT} appears with a delay compared to the voltage, such as\+: the charge carriers of the current have finite speed, they are \doxyref{produced during the measurement}{p.}{group__MEASURING__CONDUCTANCE_MEASURING_CONDUCTANCE}, or, although they have infinitely high speed, they are stored for some reason for some time and released only some time later (as the conditions within the circuit change). In a limited way, one can imitate one effect with the other. Given the lack of mathematics describing the “slow” currents, it is usual to imitate a neuronal circuit with a simple electric $RC$ circuit having capacity $C$ and resistance $R$. Biology used to express Kirchoff\textquotesingle{}s idea (applying charge conservation for modeling a neuron\textquotesingle{}s membrane ) in its differential equation form

\begin{equation} C\frac{dV}{dt}+\frac{V(t,x)-V_{rest}}{R}=0 \label{eq:KirchoffsdifferentialBad} \end{equation}

where $V(t,x)$ is the actual potential at time $t$ at position $x$, and $V_{rest}$ is the resting potential; the second term describes the actual current. However, from the \doxyref{structure of neuron\textquotesingle{}s mebrane}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC_ABSTRACT_ELECTRIC_NEURON} follows immediately that in the \doxyref{neuronal oscillator}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR_PHYSICS_MEASURING_OSCILLATOR} the capacity $C$ and resistance $R$ {\itshape are connected serially instead of parallell}. This also means we cannot apply Kirchoff\textquotesingle{}s {\itshape current law}\+: the capacitive and resistive currents are not equal, because the condenser stores part of the charge. Instead, we can use Kirchoff\textquotesingle{}s voltage law\+: the sum of voltages around a loop is zero. Because the neuron stores charge, we can express the law only in differential form\+: the voltage change on the two components

\begin{equation} C\frac{dV}{dt}-\frac{V(t,x)-V_{rest}}{R}=0 \label{eq:Kirchoffsdifferential} \end{equation}

We assume a discrete equipotential membrane with capacity $C$ and leaks through a discrete resistance $R$. Different damped oscillations can be produced depending on those parameters. The imitation is limited\+: the “rise time” gets smeared, and the output signals differ for the neural and the electric circuits. Instead of a step function, we expect for a “slow” current, we receive a smooth peak-\/like current time course (called a damped oscillator function). However, we can use the formalism developed for the “fast“ current. Adjusting its parameters allows the electric circuit to produce a behavior resemblant to a neuronal circuit.

Notice that in our imitated neuronal circuit, the peak of the “fast” current appears later. The “slow” current is seen, although the delay time is not explicitly present. If we use chained electric RC circuits, such as in the case of multi-\/compartment membrane models \cite{MathNeuroscience:2010}, \cite{MultiCompartmentNeurons:2023}, the second such circuit receives the output voltage of the first circuit at a later time, and so on. It is also described by a system of equations similar to $\eqref{Kirchoff\textnormal{\textquotesingle}s_differential}$, but they are valid at different times. Handling the many equipotential compartments attempts to cover the fact that one imitates finite membrane size and slow currents.

However, in biology no discrete elements for storing charge exist. The notion of storing charge can be used only in the sense that for the time of passing a finite-\/size element with finite propagation speed, the charge carriers spend the corresponding time in the element. That phenomenon resembles storing the charge, and that imitation enables us to describe a behavior resemblant to that of the biological circuit. Attempting to imitate the effects of biological “slow” currents using electric parallels hides that generating an \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP} is their native feature. No additional currents and sophisticated control mechanisms are needed\+: the \doxyref{Deriving-\/action-\/potential action potential}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP_MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL} is a natural consequence of the interplay of the finite speed of the “slow” ionic current and the finite size of the neuronal membrane; furthermore, that slow currents may play a role also in cognitive functions.
