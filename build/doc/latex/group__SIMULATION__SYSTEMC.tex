An (educational, demonstration and research)-\/purpose \doxyref{simulator}{p.}{SIMULATION_MAIN_PAGE} attaches the site, with complete code, examples, use cases, reproduced research results and documentation (to the \doxyref{API}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_API} documentation through the related {\itshape modules} and {\itshape classes}). {\itshape Our simulator provides a deeper understanding, a correct physical background, and it is the only one where the time is handled as part of the unified space-\/time.} In this site, the science facts are provided as cited references, and in most cases also direct hyperlink makes accessing them easy.

The closely related \doxyref{neuron simulation }{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE_MODELING_SINGLE_MAIN} details are underpinned by \doxyref{physics }{p.}{group__PHYSICS_PHYSICS_MAIN_PAGE} explanations. {\itshape None of the existing simulators handles the mentioned phenomena\+: they live in the world of the classic science grammatically translated to biological terms, without interpreting them for biology. Neither of them handles time as a physically reasonable entity; instead, they consider it as an additional (and mathematically separable) parameter in the Newtonian scene.}\doxysubsection{System\+C, the background language and engine}\label{group__SIMULATION__SYSTEMC_SIMULATION_SYSTEMC}
In the SystemC engine there exists a time resolution, a small period in which all events \textquotesingle{}happen at the same time\textquotesingle{}. (for biological neurons, a $10 \mu s$ time resolution seems to be sufficient.) for describing all its features a complete Refererence Guide \cite{SystemChome:2017} for developing the code, but using the well-\/written core of the package it is suffient to study the textbook \cite{SystemCBook:2010}.\doxysubsection{Ripes Ripes\+\_\+\+Simulator}\label{group__SIMULATION__SYSTEMC_Ripes_Simulator}
The final goal is use the technology developed in {\texttt{ the RIPES simulator}}, to visualize and manipulate variable of the neurons and their groups at different levels. Presently, program classes, demos and tests, furthermore, first of all\+: theoretical backround is provided and shared on the site.\doxysubsection{GTKWave simulator}\label{group__SIMULATION__SYSTEMC_GTKWave_Simulator}
Although it remains almost entirely hidden for the average user, the simulator is essentially an electronic design software. It produces an \textquotesingle{}Object\+Name.\+vcd\textquotesingle{} file that, correspondingly, can be analyzed using the tools of electronic design. One of the popular tools is GTKWave. The contents of the .vcd file can be displayed as shown in \doxyref{fig\+\_\+\+GTKWave\+\_\+\+Screenshot}{p.}{group__SIMULATION__SYSTEMC_fig_GTKWave_Screenshot}. (To reproduce the figure, one has to switch the signal forms to \textquotesingle{}analog stepwise\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}analog interpolated\textquotesingle{}, respectively, and increase the \textquotesingle{}insert analog height extension\textquotesingle{} to the single-\/text line annotation.)

The figure shows the time course of the \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP}, together with the corresponding \doxyref{voltage derivatives}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC_MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_DIFFERENTIATOR} produced by Physical\+Neuron. The \textquotesingle{}State\textquotesingle{} line displays how the state of the neuron changes from \textquotesingle{}Relaxing\textquotesingle{} (codename \textquotesingle{}1\textquotesingle{}) to \textquotesingle{}Computing\textquotesingle{} (codename "{}2\textquotesingle{}) for the effect of receiving the first input (just a step-\/like increase in this phase of development). After reaching the threshold voltage, the state changes to \textquotesingle{}Delivering\textquotesingle{} (codename \textquotesingle{}3\textquotesingle{}) and remains there until the membrane voltage decreases again below the threshold. When the membrane\textquotesingle{}s threshold voltage reached, a \textquotesingle{}rush-\/in\textquotesingle{} current starts that loads the membrane\textquotesingle{}s condenser to a peak voltage and slowly discharges.

The figure shows the time courses of a \textquotesingle{}\doxyref{simple delivery}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC_MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_DIFFERENTIATOR_SIMPLE}\textquotesingle{} case when the (simulated, step-\/like) synaptic inputs trigger an \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP}. The rush-\/in current produces a sharply changing time derivative, the current flowing through the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} generates another dime derivative. The resulting time derivative is their sum (or, actually, difference, given that the latter term is an outward current). This derivative has an inflection point, followed by a raising period and almost constant value. When \doxyref{integrating the resulting time derivative}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC_MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_OPERATION}, the result is the $V_{out}$ \doxyref{AP}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AP} The membrane\textquotesingle{}s resulting $\frac{dV}{dt}$ value changes sharply when entering stage \textquotesingle{}Delivering\textquotesingle{} and later changes from negative to positive; in this way forming the output voltage. Although the \doxyref{AIS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_AIS} voltage decays continuously, it is evidently visible in stage \textquotesingle{}Computing\textquotesingle{}, following the step-\/like incrementations.
