\doxysection*{Why another neuron(al) theory and simulator}

The dynamic operation of individual neurons, their connections, higher-\/level organizations and connections, and finally the brain and the mind, are still among the big mysteries of science\+: {\itshape at which point \doxyref{the non-\/living matter becomes a living one}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP_MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL}, and at which point {\bfseries{a living matter becomes intelligent}} and conscious}; whether and how all this stuff can be handled by science. The worst inheritances of neuroscience are the static view from anatomy; omitting revisiting periodically the basic hypotheses in the light of new research results; the abstractions of the classic science (the single speed, isolated pair-\/wise instant interactions) applied to biological materials without revisiting them; and applying ad-\/hoc mathematical formulas without correct physical processes (actually creating an alternative nature).

Nature is overly complex\+: science fields must use \doxyref{different approximations and abstractions}{p.}{group__PHYSICS__INTRODUCTORY_PHYSICS_Description}. In the interest of being able to describe nature, one has to pass {\texttt{ between \textquotesingle{}Scylla\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}Charybdis\textquotesingle{}}}\+: being still sufficiently accurate and detailed in describing phenomena while keeping the mathematical complexity (and computational need) of description still manageable. {\itshape No presently available theoretical description and simulator are capable to perform that task}.

We attempt to {\itshape see the forest for the trees}. Nature uses an infinite variety of implementing neurons. However, in the \doxyref{CNS}{p.}{GLOSSARY_GLOSSARY_CNS} they can cooperate with each other. \textquotesingle{}Despite the extraordinary diversity and complexity of neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity, {\itshape the nervous systems adopts {\bfseries{a number of basic principles}}} for all neurons and synapses\textquotesingle{} \cite{JohstonWuNeurophysiology:1995}. We agree that \textquotesingle{}{\itshape the fundamental task of the nervous system is to {\bfseries{communicate and process information}}}\textquotesingle{}. Furthermore, the \textquotesingle{}{\bfseries{neurons convey neural information}} by virtue of electrical and chemical signals\textquotesingle{} \cite{JohstonWuNeurophysiology:1995}. The goal was set decades ago\+: \textquotesingle{}{\itshape The ultimate aim of computational neuroscience is to explain {\bfseries{how electrical and chemical signals are used}} in the brain to {\bfseries{represent and process information}}}\textquotesingle{} \cite{SejnowskiComputationalNeuroscience:1988}. We base our discussion on those \doxyref{general basic principles}{p.}{group__MODELING__SINGLE} and create an \doxyref{\textquotesingle{}abstract physical neuron\textquotesingle{}}{p.}{classNeuronPhysical}, skipping the \textquotesingle{}implementation details\textquotesingle{} nature uses. Given that in many cases wrong physical principles, notions and measuring methods are used in modeling neurons, we need to discuss \doxyref{the true physics}{p.}{group__PHYSICS} behind biological phenomena. To do so, we need to understand {\itshape how neurons \doxyref{represent and process information}{p.}{group__COMPUTING__BASICS_COMPUTING_INFORMATION}} \cite{VeghNeuralShannon:2022}. We agree that \textquotesingle{}The basic structural units of the nervous system are individual neurons\textquotesingle{} \cite{JohstonWuNeurophysiology:1995}, but we are also aware of that neurons \char`\"{}are linked together by dynamically changing constellations of synaptic weights\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}cell assemblies are best understood in light of their output product\char`\"{} \cite{BuzsakiCellAssemblies:2010}, so we also \doxyref{model multiple neurons}{p.}{group__MODELING__MULTIPLE_MODELING_MULTIPLE_NEURONS}.

\textquotesingle{}The brain computes! This is accepted as a truism by the majority of neuroscientists.\textquotesingle{} \cite{KochBiophysics:1999} However, \textquotesingle{}{\itshape we so far {\bfseries{lack principles to understand rigorously how computation is done}}} in living, or active, matter\textquotesingle{} \cite{NaturalComputation:2018}. To understand how \char`\"{}computation is done\char`\"{}, we \doxyref{generalize computing}{p.}{group__COMPUTING__BASICS_COMPUTING} \cite{VeghRevisingClassicComputing:2021}, in close cooperation with \doxyref{communication}{p.}{group__COMPUTING__BASICS_COMPUTING_COMMUNICATION} \cite{RoleOfInformationTransferSpeed:2022}. We attempt to synthetise the available knowledge with a fresh eye, and intends to make a leap in understanding neural computing, scrutinizing our knowledge pieces one-\/by-\/one, for credibility, relation to other pieces, to other sciences, finding contradictions and its reasons, {\itshape defying fallacies}. Sometimes you may need our \doxyref{glossary }{p.}{GLOSSARY} or the search engine (see the right side of the title line).

The site is not exclusively about theory\+: we give also a programmed implementation of the ideas we describe. \doxyref{Our simulator }{p.}{group__SIMULATION__SYSTEMC_SIMULATION_SYSTEMC} has direct science base, instead of ad-\/hoc mathematical formulas; and the only one which is able to reproduce \doxyref{the true biological time course}{p.}{group__SIMULATION__SYSTEMC_SIMULATION_SYSTEMC} of neurons, from first principles of science, without arbitrary assumptions and limited variability formulas. Our methods enable discussing the major aspects from the phenomena of natural operation of neurons to analyzing the effects of invasive electricity-\/related investigation methods on neuroscience. Presently we offer some demos, class implementations, test cases to demonstrate simulating capabilities. Our intention is to develop a full-\/value educational, demonstration and research tool.

{\bfseries{Warning\+: }}Please consider that this development is a one-\/man undertaking, and it shall develop theory, software implementation, its testing and their documentation. There are pre-\/developed code fragments, science publications and docs, so it develops relatively quickly, but it needs time to put them together in a consistent state. Please come back later and see if there is something new (see the date and version).
