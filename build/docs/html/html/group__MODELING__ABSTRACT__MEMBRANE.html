<p>The integrator and differentiator are entirely different assemblies from the same components (based on the abstraction that \(R\) and \(C\) are discrete elements and the wiring is an ideal conductor), as their differential equations and waveforms show; see table <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__ABSTRACT__MEMBRANE.html#RC_circuits">RC_circuits</a>, from <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/rc">the electric tutorial</a>. Although they have the same time constant \(RC\), they form the input signal entirely differently. From the figures showing the generated signal forms, one sees that the input signal's rising edge generates a rising output voltage, and the falling edge generates a voltage with opposite sign compared to the input voltage, in resemblance with the action potential. With replacing the square wave with a physically plausible input voltage function, we have good hopes to reproduce the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> on the output of the circuit.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_NEURONAL_MEMBRANE_Physical"></a>
Physical modeling of neuronal membrane</h1>
<p>Our assumptions on the operation of an abstract neuron for generating an <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> are summarized in Figure <a class="el" href="classNeuronDemo.html#fig_AP_ConceptualDemo">fig_AP_ConceptualDemo</a>. Initally, the potential of the neuronal membrane is at the value of the resting potential and the neuron is in state 'Relaxing'. When the first synaptic input arrives, the potential value gets higher and the neuron is in state 'Computing'. The subsequent neuronal inputs may increase the potential of the membrane above the threshold level. At that point, the result of 'Computing' is ready and the neuron passes to state 'Delivering': it prepares to transfer its result, the spike, to the downstream neuron(s) through its axon. At that point, two simultaneous actions affecting charge collection take place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once, the ion channels in membrane's wall open, and ions from the adjacent layer in the extracellular space enter the membrane. The ions entering the intracellular surface promptly increase the local potential, so they in an avalanche-like way open all <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ION__CHANNEL.html#MODELING_ION_CHANNEL">ion channels</a> in their proximity, in a very short period. The ions on the extracellular side move with their diffusion speed, but they use their high thermal speed to pass the open ion channels. The process results in forming an 'empty' layer on the extracellular side, i.e., the ion inflow stops shortly due to the lack of ions. There is no need to open some \(K^+\) channels (BTW: assuming an outward \(K^+\) current is against charge conservation) and control \(K^+\) and \(Na^+\) ion channels: the different interaction speeds and finite sizes do all the business.</li>
<li>Twice, the axonal arbors stop emitting ions into the membrane. (The collected charge will not change any more, and so will their collection time: the camomputational result is ready.) The ions need to propagate against membrane's electric repulsion and they cannot enter the membrane anymore until its potential decreases below the threshold level again (this period is known as the 'absolute refractory' period); the rest of the spike remains in 'pending' state.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ion rush-in into the mebrane continues for a while, and the membrane's potential increases. The increasing potential drives a current through <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> that decrases membrane's potential (because of the finite speed of ions, they appear with a delay both on the mebrane and on the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li>Another famous point is when the the membrane potential decreases below the threshold potential. At that point, the synaptic inputs can contribute again: the neuron is in phase 'Relaxing' again. This period is mistakenly identied as 'relative refractory' period. Actually, this state is not a 'refractory'; it is 'Relaxing' starting with an elevated membrane potential. It begins earlier than the first output appears on the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. The slow axonal currents from the re-opened arbors must reach <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>, so they appear there with a delay (from different distances at different times), creating the <em>illusion that inputs are re-enabled only when the membrane voltage is about its hyperpolarized voltage value</em>. Given that the neuron is actually in a 'Relaxing' state, &ndash; due to re-opening the axonal inputs &ndash; the pending inputs can contribute again, this time to the 'next' spike. In this period the neuronal potential differs from its resting value: it implements a short-term (time-dependent) <em>neuronal memory</em>. The pending contribution is the larger the closer was the time of closing the arboral gates to the arrival of the synaptic input; a plausible explanation of Hebb's observation.</li>
</ul>
<p>With introducing the idea of 'slow current', we arrive at a clear interpretation of the observed refractory period. The synaptic inputs are closed when membrane's potential is above the threshold potential, and they are open below that value. This distinction may be important in the presence of 'artificial' currents (clamping and patching): the current adds a potential offset to the voltage level; furthermore, the patching current may arrive through a 'valved' axon. If that offset becomes higher than the threshold, no synaptic input can be received. Actually, the refractory period reflects an 'all or nothing' feature of the synapses: they are either open or closed, without a third state.</p>
<p>The ions entering the membrane (in some sense, in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the membrane) charge the membrane to its saturation value with a large time constant. The charges, under the effect of electrostatic repulsion and the voltage gradient due to the current drain at the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>, start to move along the membrane's surface, forming a macroscopic slow current. Given that the electrostatic interaction is very strong, we may assume that the neuronal membrane is equipotential, except the region immediately in front of the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> where the current drain works. The charges 'created' at different distances from the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> need different times to arrive.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_NEURONAL_MEMBRANE"></a>
Electrical modeling of neuronal membrane</h1>
<p>For electrical modeling, we can use the approximation that a distributed condenser (the neuronal membrane) and a discrete resistor (the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>) form an \(RC\) circuit. It is clear that all currents (including the synaptic currents, the membrane's rush-in current, and the artificial currents either patching them directly to the membrane or clamping them to its axons) flow into the condenser (and cause potential increases calculated using membrane's capacitance), furthermore the potential drops only due to the current flowing through the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. It is the exact equivalent of <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/rc/rc-differentiator.html">a passive RC <b>differentiator</b> circuit</a>: "the input is connected to a capacitor while the output voltage is taken from across a resistance" and not to be mismatched with <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/rc/rc-integrator.html">a passive RC <b>integrator</b> circuit</a> where "the input is connected to a resistance while the output voltage is taken from across a capacitor".</p>
<p>We must not mismatch voltages on the input and output sides of the \(RC\) circuit, furthermore we must be aware of the the basic electric entities on the two sides of the \(RC\) circuit are not any more in connection that Ohm's Law prediscts. Eq. \(\eqref{eq:RC_Differentiator}\) shows that the <em>output voltage</em> is formed by differentiating the <em>input voltage</em>. Similarly, the currents on the two sides are different: the difference is stored in the form of <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT.html#PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT">slowly moving current</a>. As we discussed, the <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SPEEDS.html#PHYSICS_Speeds_Finite">the finite speed</a> modifies the interpretation of the conservation laws; Kichoff's Law is valid only in its differential form. The charge conservation remains valid, but only in a broader sense; an important consequence of the non-instant interaction speed plus the finite size distributed capacitance.</p>
<p>According to eq. \(\eqref{eq:RC_Differentiator}\), when working with the 'native' inputs of the neuron, one needs to work with the <em>time derivative of the input voltage they cause in the membrane</em>. The input voltage \(V_{IN}\) comprises different contributors, and the differentiation is linear; i.e., we shall sum up the different \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) terms linearly. </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} V_{out}(t) = RC \sum \frac{dV_{IN}}{dt} \label{eq:OutputMembraneVoltage} \end{equation}
</p>
<p>To describe the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a>, the output voltage of the \(RC\) circuit, we need to provide all contributions \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) and solve the differential equation numerically. Because of the presence of slow currents, the membrane potential \(V(x,t)\) depends on both location and time, we confine our discussion to the infintesimal thin region immediately in front of <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>, in this way reducing the voltage function to \(V_{AIS}(t)\). We have a voltage contribution</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} \frac{d}{dt}(V_M-V_{Rest}) \end{equation}
</p>
<p> due to the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>,</p>
<p>We know that In the case of a simple <em>differentiator</em> \(RC\) circuit, the capacitor current of the membrane with capacity \(C\) is expressed as </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} I_C=\frac{dQ}{dt}=C\frac{dV_{IN}}{dt}\label{eq:CapacitorCurrent} \end{equation}
</p>
<p> given that the voltage is the usual primary quantity. In biology, sometimes it is more practical to express the same relation with the component currents in a reversed way </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} \frac{dV_{IN}}{dt}(t) = \frac{I_C(t)}{C} \label{eq:MembraneVoltage} \end{equation}
</p>
<p> Anyhow, the input currents produce a voltage time derivate independently as described by \(\eqref{eq:RC_Differentiator}\), and their effect (the increase in the value of \(V_{OUT}\) as calculated from Eq. \(\eqref{eq:DifferentiatorEquation}\)) sum up linearly. Of course, the voltage change of different input currents (including the ones due to membrane's charge-up, synaptic inputs and 'artificial currents') contribute independently. The resulting currents \(I_C\) are summed, and on the output resistance \(I_R\) create an output voltage</p>
<p>However, their time course is different: the slow currents need different travel time and the different contributions have different time distributions. In the case of biology, the gating mechanisms complicate the process The membrane charge-up starts only when the membrane's voltage is above the membrane's threshold voltage, and conversely, the synaptic inputs are active only when the membrane's voltage is below the membrane's threshold voltage, The patching and clamping contributions have external control. The resulting output voltage measurable on the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> simply comprises the sum of all those contributions. The time derivatives of the different voltages can be calculated using different physical models.</p>
<p>The membrane is considered as infinitesimally small ("point-like") equipotential insulator piece surface, and its operation is thought to be closely aligned with that of an electric <em>RC</em> circuit. That model needs introducing fake physical and enzimatical mechanisms as well as defining mathematical relations between independently operating biological components.</p>
<p>Unlike that model, our abstract model considers the correct behavior of different interactions operating those abstract components, and can explain the operation of a neuron from the first principles. Among others, that controling the ion channels in membranes's wall, inhibiting its synaptic inputs in well-defined phases of creating an action potential, emitting an <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL">action potential</a> <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> with its precise shape and timing, are a natural consequence of receiving finite-speed currents by a finite-size neuronal membrane. <a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/">Neuronal dynamics</a></p>
<p>For the sake of the discussion in this section (explaining semi-quantitatively <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL">action potential</a> is created) we assume the neuron's membrane as a long, narrow and thin rectangular isolating surface with controlled ion channels in its wall, junctions at different points for controlled synaptic current inputs, furthermore a specific point for output current/voltage, the Axon Initial Segment (<a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>). The current flowing on the membrane comprises ions, which represent a kind of <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT.html#PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT">slow current</a>. On the surface of the isolating membrane the electric processes attempt to maintain equal potentials. The <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> represents a permanent (but voltage-dependent) drain current \( I_{AIS}\), the synaptic inputs \( I_{SYN,i}\) contribute (time-dependent and gated) continuous input currents; with a characteristic time comparable to that of the characteristic time of the action pontential. Furthermore, there is a step-function-like contribution due to the ions rushing into the intracellular space when the ion channels in membrane's wall open at reaching the threshold voltage. In experimental investigations, a clamping voltage \( I_{CLAMP}\) is switched to an axon (acts as a <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON.html#MODELING_SINGLE_AXON">current generator</a>, despite that it is intended to be a voltage generator) or \( I_{DIRECT}\) current is introduced directly into the cell.</p>
<p>The "leaking current" \( I_{AIS}\) is active all the time. It is proportional to the difference of the <em>potential at <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> above the resting potential</em>, and the ion channels in <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> can be characterized by a discrete \(R\) resistance value. The synaptic inputs \( I_{SYN,i}\) are active only in the charge-up and relative refractory period (actually, when <em>the membrane potential is below the threshold value</em>: otherwise the ions cannot enter the intracellular space against the higher membrane potential)</p>
<p>Because the ions (implementing the membrane current) are slow, the potential they create changes continuously, in the function of location and time. The <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> is forwarded through the axon using the voltage immediately in front of the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. This means that to derive the time course of the action potential, we need to consider the infinitesimal segment immediately in front of <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>, and to take into account that the slow current reaches that place under finite period. That is, we must consider both \(\eqref{eq:Kirchoff_biology}\) and \(\eqref{eq:Kirchoffs_differential}\)</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} C\frac{dV}{dt}+\frac{V(t,x)-V_{rest}}{R}+I_{MEMB}(t)+I_{SYN,i}(t)+I_{CLAMP}(t)+I_{DIRECT}(t) =0 \label{eq:Kirchoffscomplete} \end{equation}
</p>
<p>The last two items are "foreign" contributions. In the simple case when after reaching the threshold potential ions rush in the intracellular space, , and the membrane current can be described as follows.</p>
<p>The ions rushing in the intracellular space, on the entire surface of the membrane, actually pass the ion channel with their thermal speed (in our approach: instantly) and they quickly reach a saturation level, meaning that both the voltage and the current that can flow away will be saturated, with a short time constant: the inflow is extremely quick and the ions shall diffuse to a small distance in the vicinity of the exit of the ion channel. That elevated membrane potential is connected to the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> (represented as resistance \(R\), and a current can start. However, only the ions in the infinitesimal segment immediately in front of the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> can pass its ion channels, so the ions farther from <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> first have to reach that infinitesimal segment, that takes time. These two processes happen at the same time, so the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> will see the resulting current</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} I_{MEMB}(t,x) = (1-\exp(-a*t))*exp(-b*t) \label{eq:MembraneCurrent} \end{equation}
</p>
<p>For the simple case when the threshold potential have been reached, the synaptic inputs get blocked and no "foreign" current is present, Kirchoff's Junction Law can be described as</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} C\frac{dV}{dt}+\frac{V(t,x)-V_{rest}}{R}+I_{MEMB}(t,x) =0 \label{eq:Kirchoffspartial} \end{equation}
</p>
<p>where \(C\) is the capacity that can be interpreted for the system, see also <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT.html#PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT">how the classic physics imitates slow current</a>.</p>
<p>The 'artificial' inputs (patching and clamping) mostly add a constant current, that produces a zero time derivate on the membrane and result in a constant output voltage. Given that the amount of current through the current drain is limited by the resistivity \(R\) of <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>, and it depends on the actual membrane voltage, introducing too high currents may lead to unnatural effects. If the external current integrated for a neuronal operating cycle exceeds the similary integrated maximum current the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> can transmit, the neuron "overflows": the extra charge leaves to the extracellular space and the neuronal cyle stops working. Any external current moves the work point where the 'native' inputs get effective again and the neuron can enter the 'Refractory' phase; after some point the neuron stops emitting <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a>s.</p>
<p>The membrane's potential around the threshold value acts as a dual-circuit switch:</p><ul>
<li>When 'artificial currents' (or too frequent incoming spikes) increase membrane's voltage permanently to be around the threshold level, the ion channels in membrane's wall will be in ill-defined state. Being very close to the threshold, small transients of the membrane's voltage may cause apparently unexpected</li>
