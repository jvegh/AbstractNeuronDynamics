Physical description of nature</h1>
<p>To describe the infinite variety of nature, <em>we need a consistent model that comprises all relevant interactions and aligns with the notions of the related other science fields</em>. To describe the related phenomena, we must scrutinize, case by case, which interaction are significant and which interaction(s) can be omitted instead of setting up ad-hoc models that contradict each other if used outside their range of validity. To provide their correct description, we must understand the corresponding electric behavior of living material, including that it works with slow ion currents, electrically active, non-isotropic, structured materials, and consequently, its temporal behavior (the speeds of interactions) matters. We must consider macroscopic and microscopic phenomena at the same time, different science fields, and their interplay. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1705704114">Living complex systems in particular create high-ordered functionalities by pairing up low-ordered complementary processes, e.g., one process to build and the other to correct.</a> <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_BiologicalConservationLaw:2017">[26]</a> We need to check the validity of our abstractions. We arrived at the boundaries of classic science fields and are moving now through terra incognita.</p>
<p>Biology uses the idea of "instant interaction" borrowed from classic physics and describes its "slow" currents using equations developed for instant interaction; i.e., as they were "fast" currents. The lack of idea about slow currents leads to the introduction of fake currents (which have no source, change the ion type, introduce non-physical delays between the two secondary electric entities voltage and current, and so on). <em>Experimental biology sees the time, but its theory does not want to admit it.</em> Instead of introducing that biological processes need time, biology introduces that physics has a wrong notion about speed, space, time, and electricity. Unfortunately, biophysics participates in this business: in some cases simply translates notions, terms and equations from classic physics (mainly theory of electricity), without validating that the original abstraction remains valid in the case of biology.</p>
<p>Galilei said, "Mathematics is the language in which God has written
the universe". However, it is not sure that when we attempt to read a piece of the universe written in that language, we use the right piece of the language, and even that humans already discovered the needed piece. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus">mathematical calculus</a> (integral and differential) was invented mainly for the practical needs of analysing spatial motion of bodies. Similarly, Minkowski's mathematics theory extended widely <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_EinsteinMinkowskiRelativity:1977">[28]</a> after inventing the special theory of relativity. Formerly, no mathematical description existed. The classic Laws of motion are valid only until more meticulous observations require to consider speed and acceleration dependence in addition space dependence. Mathematics and math formulas work with numbers and they describe nature only if they are used within their range of validity, has not much sense. Using mathematics to describe the classic equations of motion, to calculate forces and times that speed up bodies above the speed of light is possible, but in that case mathematics is applied to an inappropriate approximation of nature: when approaching the speed of light, different physical approximation (that calls for different mathematical handling) is to be used. <em>A mathematical formula without naming which interactions are described by them and naming under which conditions the formula can be applied are just numbers without meaning and only eventually describes what we studied.</em> Galilei made measurements with object having friction, but his careful analysis extrapolated his results to the abstraction that no friction was present. We know his name because of making meticulous abstractions and omissions (and mainly: recognizing the need to do so!) instead of publishing a vast amount of half-understood measured data.</p>
<p>Nature is infinitely complex, and science must make abstractions for a particular assembly of phenomena to describe them using a piece of that language with reasonable accuracy. We create a dialect of that universal language and validate its usage for that assembly of phenomena. Different science fields may use different abstractions and dialects, creating new ones or attempting to inherit them from other science fields. However, in the latter case, <em>we must not borrow their validation without scrutinizing whether in the case of our abstractions they remain valid</em>. To describe its electric operations, biology borrowed laws and equations from physics, where it was assumed that the speed of interaction is the speed of <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_EM">EM</a> interaction. Although technical electricity knows and describes that macroscopic currents are a million times slower and different laws describe them, biology did not borrow the idea or where it did (the telegrapher's equation); it did it incorrectly.</p>
<p>Believing that the mathematical equations developed for the abstraction of "instant interaction" of classic physics are valid for biology, leads to describing a surrealistic virtual nature, where charges are not present but creating potential (see the clamping measurement and describing <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> with an oscillator); the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/9173">conductance depends on the applied voltage</a> <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_KochVoltageDependentConductance:1999">[34]</a>, and that conductance governs biological operation; the mystic reason of creating <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> is "based on an indirect inference, that excitatory inputs interact sublinearly when located somewhere in the distal dendritic tree" (for a review see section 5.2 in <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_KochBiophysics:1999">[18]</a>); signals propagate with delays without assuming that it happens due to the finite speed of current that delivers the signal; applying telegrapher's equations, which assume that current flows out of the cable, to the case of axons where the current remains the same while it travels; modeling and showing dependencies of infinite-speed electric circuits for finite-speed biological circuits; applying Kirchoff's Conservation Law to space segments where ions are created inside (diffuse into the segment); that the temporal operation due to many-synaptic inputs is governed by some cross-correlation of independent inputs; that the information processing of time-dependent analog signals is described by a formalism developed for time-independent digital signals.</p>
<p>Since Euclid, we know "there is no royal road to geometry". We add that there is no biologist's road to nature. The true nature is different from the one they assume, and one must derive the proper approximations relevant to the studied phenomena, usually comprising several interactions with speeds differing by orders of magnitude. They are also present in the case of electricity in metals, from the speed of <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_EM">EM</a> interaction down to the drift speed of electrons. Even we know that the speed of a macroscopic current is between those two extreme values. Extrapolating our notions about the macroscopic world to the microscopic one and assuming the classic interaction speed (the "instant
interaction") abstracted from the vast interaction speed of <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_EM">EM</a> waves to at least ten orders of magnitude lower interaction speed is misleading.</p>
<p>Biological objects, with their semipermeable membranes, separating ionic solutions into sections with concentrations differing by orders of magnitude, furthermore containing voltage-controlled ion channels that react actively to electric fields, are more complex cases for understanding their detailed operation. Classic theory cannot explain some details of neurophysiological phenomena, including neurons' charge processing, especially their temporal behavior, that implements its information processing capability because physiology incorrectly interprets the fundamental electric terms. Extrapolating notions derived from metals to electrolytes, especially to biological neurons with electrically active internal structures, may be misleading.</p>
<p>It is hazardous to introduce technically (and incorrectly) derived and misinterpreted macroscopic features and interpret them as a fundamental electric notion. The idea of <a class="el" href="group__MEASURING__CONDUCTANCE.html#MEASURING_CONDUCTANCE"><em>conductance</em></a> has been introduced to neurophysiology decades ago. It was taken from physics, where the notion was derived for metals. Since then, its original interpretation has been forgotten, and today (in contrast with physics), it has become a primary entity for describing electric characteristics of biological cells. We explain how the right physics background enables one to discover wrong physical models and <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING.html">misinterpreted notions of physics in neurophysiology</a>; furthermore, how it opens the way to the correct interpretation of neuronal information. We set up an abstract electric model of neuronal operation (see section <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC">MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC</a>).</p>
<p>Science is, unfortunately, separated into classic and modern science based on whether the theoretical description assumes infinitely fast interaction (the Newtonian model) or acknowledges the finite interaction speed (the Einsteinian model). However, the finite interaction speed is erroneously associated with the speed of light and frames of reference moving relative to each other with speeds approaching the speed of light. Assuming that the interaction speed is finite (using the speed of light as the value for its external parameter) is sufficient to build up the special theory of relativity <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_ModernRelativity:1993">[7]</a>. Still, the Minkowski-mathematics <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Minkowski:1908">[10]</a> behind the special theory of relativity works with any speed parameter <em>c</em>. The same mathematics describes technical <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_VeghRevisingClassicComputing:2021">[40]</a> and biological <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_RoleOfInformationTransferSpeed:2022">[37]</a> computing systems, where there are no moving reference frames, but the finite interaction speed has noticeable effects on the operation of the system.</p>
<p>Classic physics is based on the Newtonian idea that everything happens simultaneously; space and time are absolute. Consequently, if objects interact, the interaction must be instantaneous; in other words, their interaction speed is infinitely large. Furthermore, electromagnetic waves with the same high (but finite) speed inform the observer. This self-consistent abstraction enables us to provide a "nice" mathematical description of nature in various phenomena: the classic science. In the first year of college, we learned that the idea resulted in "nice" reciprocal square dependencies, Kepler's and Coulomb's Laws. We discussed that the macroscopic phenomenon "current" is implemented at the microscopic level by transferring (in different forms) "atomic" charge. Furthermore, that <em>without charge, neither potential nor current exists</em>. In the following year, we learned that the speed of light is finite and that solids show a macroscopic behavior "resistance" against forwarding microscopic charges.</p>
<p>Still, we need a different abstraction (finite-speed interaction in modern physics) for different phenomena that require different mathematical handling, which is not as simple and friendly. The <em>speeds of observation</em> and propagation of electric fields remain the same in biology, and it is easy to extrapolate, mistakenly, that <em>all</em> interactions have infinitely large interaction speeds. However, also <em>slow</em> interaction speeds exist. Neglecting that effect introduces the need to assume fake mechanisms and effect to be able to explain some details; which are naturally explained by assuming finite interaction speeds and their combinations. </p>
