<i>"Though this be madness, yet there is method in't."</i> (<b>Shakespeare: Hamlet: Act 2 Scene 2</b>)

<h1>Why another neuron(al) theory and  simulator</h1>

The dynamic operation of individual neurons, their connections, higher-level organizations and connections,
and finally the brain and the mind,
are still among the big mysteries of science: <i>at which point
@link MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL the non-living matter becomes a living one@endlink,
and at which point <b>a living matter becomes intelligent</b> and conscious</i>; whether and how
all this stuff can be handled by science.
The worst inheritances of neuroscience are the static view from anatomy;
omitting revisiting periodically the basic hypotheses in the light of new research results;
the abstractions of the classic science
(the single speed, isolated pair-wise instant interactions)
applied to biological materials without revisiting them;
and applying ad-hoc mathematical formulas without correct physical processes in the backgound
(actually creating an alternative nature).


Nature is overly complex: science fields must use
@link PHYSICS_Description different approximations and abstractions@endlink.
In the interest of being able to describe nature, one has to pass
<a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charybdis">between 'Scylla' and 'Charybdis'</a>: being still
sufficiently accurate and detailed in describing phenomena while keeping the mathematical complexity
(and computational need) of description still manageable.
<i>No presently available theoretical description and simulator are capable to perform that task</i>.

We attempt to <i>see the forest for the trees</i>.
Nature uses an infinite variety of implementing neurons. However, in the \gls{CNS} they can cooperate
with each other. 'Despite the extraordinary diversity and complexity of neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity,
<i>the nervous systems adopts <b>a number of basic principles</b></i> for all neurons and synapses'
@cite JohstonWuNeurophysiology:1995.
We agree that '<i>the fundamental task of the nervous system is to <b>communicate and process information</b></i>'.
Furthermore, the '<b>neurons convey
neural information</b> by virtue of electrical and chemical signals'
@cite JohstonWuNeurophysiology:1995.
The goal was set decades ago:
'<i>The ultimate aim of computational neuroscience is
to explain <b>how electrical and chemical signals are used</b> in the brain
to <b>represent and process information</b></i>'
@cite SejnowskiComputationalNeuroscience:1988.
We base our discussion on those @link MODELING_SINGLE general basic principles@endlink
and create an @link NeuronPhysical 'abstract physical neuron'@endlink,
skipping the 'implementation details' nature uses.
Given that in many cases wrong physical principles, notions and measuring methods are used in
measuring and modeling neurons,
we need to discuss @link PHYSICS the true physics@endlink behind biological phenomena.
To do so, we need to understand <i>how neurons @link COMPUTING_INFORMATION represent and process
information@endlink</i>
@cite VeghNeuralShannon:2022.
We agree that 'The basic structural units of the nervous system are individual neurons'
@cite JohstonWuNeurophysiology:1995, but
we are also aware of that neurons 'are linked together
by dynamically changing constellations of synaptic weights' and
'cell assemblies are best understood in light of their output product' @cite BuzsakiCellAssemblies:2010,
so we also @link  MODELING_MULTIPLE_NEURONS model multiple neurons@endlink.



'The brain computes!
This is accepted as a truism by the majority of neuroscientists.' @cite KochBiophysics:1999
However, '<i>we so far <b>lack principles to understand rigorously how computation is done</b></i>
in living, or active, matter' @cite NaturalComputation:2018.
To understand how "computation is done", we @link COMPUTING generalize computing@endlink @cite VeghRevisingClassicComputing:2021,
in close cooperation with @link COMPUTING_COMMUNICATION communication@endlink @cite RoleOfInformationTransferSpeed:2022.
We attempt to synthetise the available knowledge with a fresh eye, and intend to make a leap
in understanding neural computing,
scrutinizing our knowledge
pieces one-by-one, for credibility, relation to other pieces, to other sciences,
finding contradictions and its resolutions,  <i>defying fallacies</i>.
Sometimes you may need our \link GLOSSARY glossary \endlink or the search engine
(see the right side of the title line).

The site is not exclusively about theory: we give also a programmed implementation of the ideas we describe.
@link SIMULATION_SYSTEMC Our simulator @endlink has direct science base, instead of ad-hoc mathematical formulas;
and the only one which is able to reproduce @link SIMULATION_SYSTEMC the true biological time course@endlink of neurons,
from first principles of science, without arbitrary assumptions and limited variability formulas.
Our methods enable discussing the major aspects from the phenomena of natural operation of neurons
to analyzing the effects of invasive electricity-related investigation methods on neuroscience.
Presently we offer some demos, class implementations, test cases
to demonstrate simulating capabilities. Our intention is to develop a full-value
educational, demonstration and research tool.

<b>Warning: </b>Please consider that this development is a one-man undertaking,
and it shall develop theory, evaluation of published experiment, software implementation, its  testing and their documentation.
There exist pre-developed code fragments, science publications
and docs, so it develops relatively quickly,
but it needs time to put them together in a consistent state.
Please come back later and see if there is something new (see the date and version).
