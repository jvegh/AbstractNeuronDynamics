<h1><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_COMPARING"></a>
Comparing our model to others</h1>
<p>The infinitely sophisticated operation of neurons and their network forces us to analyze their components, operation, interface and cooperation individually, case by case. Our 'abstract' approach means that we focus on the electric aspects of operation and omit the 'implementation details' nature uses. <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE.html">Our model</a> bases on <em>the first principles of science</em>, and derives the appropriate <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__ABSTRACTION.html#PHYSICS_ABSTRACTIONS">abstractions and approximations</a>. We put a physical picture behind the neuronal operation, make an abstraction by analyzing the respective processes, especially their speed of interaction and contribution to the phenomenon we want to describe. Then we make an approximation by omitting the non-relevant interactions.</p>
<p>We divide the complex process into stages where in all stages a dominant interaction can be identified. For the remained contributions we derive a mathematical formula (usually some combination of formulas describing more simple interactions), and <em>draw the range of validity of applying that formula</em>. Given that the neuronal operation is a many-player game with many interactions between the components, we put together a neuronal process from several adjacent stages. The interaction types and partners change stage by stage, and so do the math formulas we use. However, in every single stage we do provide a physical background between different components of the system having different interactions.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_PHYSICAL"></a>
Physical neuron models</h1>
<p>The so called <em>physical neuron models</em> attempt to put a physical picture behind their math formulas (notice that they create the correspondance between the phenomena and equations in a way opposite to our one).</p>
<p>The goal of the classic authors Hodgkin and Huxley <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a> was 'find equations which describe the conductances with reasonable accuracy and are sufficiently simple for theoretical calculation of the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> and refractory period' <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a>. They did a too good and meticulous (nearly perfect) job, that covered their wrong hypotheses. They correctly evaluated their method 'The agreement [between our theory and experiments] <em>must not be taken as evidence</em> that our equations are anything more than an <em>empirical description</em> of the time-course of the changes in permeability to sodium and potassium'. They faithfully added that '<em>the interpretation given is unlikely to provide a correct picture of the membrane</em>'. Their followers forgot both their evaluation and the method they followed.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_HODGKIN_HUXLEY"></a>
The Hodgkin-Huxley model</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html">online book</a> on neuronal dynamics provides a very thorough discussion of the famous Hodgkin-Huxley model <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a>. This was the very first attempt to provide a science-based model for the <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC">electric operation of a neuron</a>, and it was the very first step on a <em>terra incognita</em>. Setting it up, enormously advanced our understanding in the field and deserved the Nobel-prize. However, during the passed decades, the knowledge base has significantly extended. At some points the model must be enhanced. Its simplified ideas served very well in understanding the basics, but to discuss the finer details, many of its statements and assumptions must be modified. Here we confine the discussion to some general aspects, details are provided throughout the different sections of the site.</p>
<p>Although it is commonly called 'model', the authors evaluated their method that <em>the success of the equations is no evidence in favour of the mechanism</em> of permeability change that we tentatively had in mind when formulating them' <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a>, page 541. They were aware of that although 'certain features of our equations were capable of a physical interpretation', a '<em>physical theory of this kind does not lead to satisfactory functions ... without further <b>ad hoc assumptions</b></em>' <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a>. Their followers took over their tentative hypotheses and ad-hoc assumptions as fact, introduced further ad-hoc assumptions, needed to provide satisfactory agreement with the experimental evidence, into their admittedly wrong physical picture. So, those 'physical' models, starting from their hypothesis, lack the 'evidence in favour of the mechanism'. Unfortunately, some of their key hypotheses <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a> were really wrong.</p>
<p>First, at that time the <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#ABSTRACT_ELECTRIC_NEURON">structure of neuronal mebrane</a> was not known. The experimental microscopic resolution of their time did not enable them to discover finer details such as the Axon Initial Segment <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. Second, due to the lack of knowing the role (and the existence, at all) of the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>, they assumed the wrong type of the <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR.html#PHYSICS_MEASURING_OSCILLATOR">neuronal oscillator</a>. Third, hypothesising a parallelly switched \(RC\) equivalent electric circuit, many critical points of their discussion concerning the <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC">electric operation</a> must be extended, enhanced and fixed. Among others, that not the <em>ionic currents</em> themselves, but the <em>voltage time dependence</em> (time derivative) controls the neuronal membrane's operation. Furthermore, that not some mystic outward \(K^+\) current causes the experienced hyperpolarization; instead, the 'capacitive current' of the correct oscillator circuit. In addition, they did not consider that biology operates using <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT.html#PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT">slow currents</a>, although they observed that the phenomena '<em>depend on the movement of some component of the membrane ... which behaves as though it had a large charge</em>'. Furthermore, they had the point-like neurons in mind. These concepts must be extended/changed to enable understanding of, among otthers, how and why the <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL">Action Potential</a> is evoked and how neurons process and transmit information using electric currents.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_MATHEMATICAL"></a>
Mathematical neuron models</h2>
<p><a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x635.png">In formal models of spiking neurons the shape of an action potential (dashed line) is usually replaced by a \(\delta\) pulse (vertical line). The negative overshoot (spike-afterpotential) after the pulse is replaced by a ‘reset’ of the membrane potential to the value of resting potential. </a> That is, formal models throw away neuronal memory and so neural cooperation, among others.</p>
