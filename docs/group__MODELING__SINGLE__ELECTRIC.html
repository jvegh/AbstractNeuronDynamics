<p><a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SPEEDS.html#PHYSICS_SPEEDS">Nature shows various speeds and intermixes them</a>, also in connection with electricity. Scrutinizing the basic notions of <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING.html">Measuring electric entities</a> discovers that some abstractions derived for electric phenomena in metals seem to be invalid for biology: it uses fake ideas and notions about electricity. We set up an abstract electrical model of neuronal operation, which enables us to understand how neurons process the charge of ions. Our detailed model enables us, among others, to show that <em>the famous <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> is a natural consequence of processing finite-speed currents by finite-size membranes</em>.</p>
<p>The 'slow current' phenomenon, a key aspect of our research, was discovered early <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a>, but misinterpreted. The presence of 'slow current' or 'delayed rectifier current' (and even the simultaneous presence of 'slow' and 'fast' currents, for a review, see <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_SodiumCurrentDelay:2006">[5]</a>) was observed, and the wording was introduced. However, its meaning is ill-defined: a delay in the time course of an instantaneous current or delayed activation of some biological process instead of some speed. When properly understood, this phenomenon could provide crucial insights into the fine details of the operation of the brain, necessitating a fresh start in neurobiology.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our research paves the way for interpreting neuronal information processing in terms of true neuronal charge processing. One needs to pay more attention to the biological information representation to derive information-related notions for the brain's operation to satisfy Shannon's strict mathematical conditions <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_VeghNeuralShannon:2022">[62]</a>. Attempting to reproduce the brain's information-related functionality, based <em>only</em> on its well-described anatomy, without understanding and reproducing its sophisticated temporal operation led directly to the collapse of the European Human Brain Project <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_EuroBrainImplosion:2020">[43]</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC"></a>
Electric operation</h1>
<p>The idea that phenomena with 'ionized substances' 'may be expressed in electrical terms' <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_COLE_CURTIS_IMPEDANCE:1939">[16]</a> is around since the beginning of the last century. In 1952, Hodgkin and Huxley (<a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a>, Figure 1) introduced the Nobel-prize winner idea of modeling neuron as an electric \(RC\) oscillator circuit (with current, potential, resistance/conductance and capacitance), although implemented using biological methods and materials. As they introduced, the neuron can be represented as a connected combination of discrete elements, a resistor \(R\) and a capacitor \(C\), a <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR.html#PHYSICS_MEASURING_OSCILLATOR">well-known electric element</a>. In the case of biology it is implemented with a charge storage element (membrane), a current drain (the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>, causing a voltage drop) and several current sources, 'native' (synaptic) and 'artificial' (patching and clamping) currents (causing a voltage raise). However, there are two possibilities to combine those elements, and those two combinations have <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR.html#PHYSICS_MEASURING_OSCILLATOR">drastically different behavior</a>.</p>
<p>We aim to upload instead of defy the explanations Hodgkin and Huxley made. Their summary was that "The agreement [between their theory and experiments] <em>must not be taken as evidence</em> that our equations are anything more than an <em>empirical description</em> of the time-course of the changes in permeability to sodium and potassium" and "certain features of our equations were capable of a physical interpretation, but <em>the success of the equations is no evidence in favour of the mechanism</em> of permeability change that we tentatively had in mind when formulating them" <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a>, page 541.</p>
<p>Instead, we add the building stone their work missed, to provide a <em>firm scientific background</em> to their enlightening observation that 'it seems difficult to escape the conclusion that <em>the changes</em> in ionic permeability <em>depend on the movement of some component of the membrane</em> <em>which behaves as though it had a large charge</em>'. The idea, that <em>a slow movement of charge carriers</em> may hide in the background also appears explicitly: &lsquo;it is necessary to suppose that there are more carriers and that they react or move more slowly.&rsquo; In other words, <em>they noticed the presence of a <a class="el" href="">&lsquo;slow&rsquo; current</a> that behaves differently from the &lsquo;fast&rsquo; currents that their equations describe</em>. Elaborating their genial observation was blocked by using a fake parallel taken from the theory of electricity that the interaction under study has an infinitely large propagation speed. This is why they felt that 'the interpretation given is unlikely to provide a correct picture of the membrane' <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a>, although as they evaluated 'the only important difference is that the theoretical current has too little delay at the sodium potential; this reflects the inability of our equations to account fully for the delay in the rise of \(g_K\)'. They had to introduce the \(K^+\) current to compensate for the wrong oscillator type, and their equations applied to the wrong type of oscillator cannot describe the features of a non-existing current, even if some conclusions are confirmed when empirical factors compensate the exact theoretical consequences.</p>
<p>As they wrote in their former paper <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxleyCurrentVoltage:1952">[28]</a> 'repolarization during the falling phase <em>probably</em> depends on an outflow of potassium ions'; they provided a hypothesis without proving it. Similarly, they cited later <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a>, page 505, that '<em>Evidence that the capacity current and ionic current are in parallel</em>' is experimentally underpinned. However, in their former paper the same conclusion is critically annotated that although '<em>at short times</em> the relation between ionic current density and membrane potential is qualitatively similar' to the theoretical derivation, '<em>more quantitative comparisons are invalidated</em> by the fact that the <u>ionic current is a function of time as well as of membrane potential</u>' (underlined by hand in the downloadable copy of the paper). Their equations '<em>cannot account for the delay in the rise of \(g_K\)</em>' (actually, the \(Na^+\) <a class="el" href="group__MEASURING__CONDUCTANCE.html#MEASURING_CONDUCTANCE">current, instead of the \(K^+\) conductance, changes</a>) because that current does not exist. (Hypothesizing $K^+$ in all cases leads to some discrepancy, see for example 'It is counter- intuitive that removing a potassium conductance would decrease the excitability of a neuron' <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_BeanActionPotential:2007">[7]</a>.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their basically correct hypothesis (that there is resemblance to the electric oscillator), was accompanied with chosing the wrong oscillator type, that forced introducing a non-existing \(K^+\) current. These two wrong hypotheses were validated by a third wrong hypothesis that in biology the conductance of electric components is changing irrationally due-to non-science reasons. The <em>empirically determined conductance function</em> of course hides the deviation caused by chosing a wrong oscillator model, which effect is partly compensated by introducing a wrong 'rectifying current' and a non-physical delay between the two primary appearance of charges 'voltage' and 'current'. We emphasize again that they attempted to give a picture of <em>which physical processes are behind neuronal operation</em>; their successors did not ask thoose questions. They did have doubts whether their hypotheses were perfectly valid (they used the word 'probably'), but the science community wanted to believe they were right, and instead of fixing those wrong assumptions by understanding the correct science background, they approved their model that neurons behave like electric circuits (by adding that some components behave in a non-Ohmic way).</p>
<p>They advanced science enormously, no doubt. The major issue with their model is that (as they admitted) it concludes a basically wrong description (irrealistic delay) of sudden changes, such as the arrival of a spike, of making clamping measurements, or of interpreting the mechanism of neuronal information transfer. The reason is that <em>they omitted the temporal course of electric processes</em>.</p>
<p>With introducing the <a class="el" href="">'slow' current</a>, and the <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR.html#PHYSICS_MEASURING_OSCILLATOR">the correct type of oscillator</a> (furthermore, providing the correct mathematical and physical background), <em>we turn their empirical description to established theory for describing neuronal operation from the first principles, which Hodgkin and Huxley expected to be not possible</em> <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a>. We prove that the 'capacitive current' in the right oscillator type was misindentified with the ' \(K^+\) current' in the wrong oscillator type and show that fitting a polynomial to their good experimental data misguided science development. Our interpretation also adds new physiological results, furthermore reveals and fixes minor mistakes.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="ABSTRACT_ELECTRIC_NEURON"></a>
Electronics' view of neuronal membrane</h1>
<p>From the discussion and figure above, it is clear that the right choice is a <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/rc/rc-differentiator.html"><b>differentiator</b></a> where 'the input signal is applied to one side of the capacitor with the output taken across the resistor'. The currents are directly created on the membrane (condenser) and the output voltage (<a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a>) is taken across the resistor (<a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>). In other words: <em>The neuronal membrane is a serial instead of a parallel circuit</em>, with far-reaching consequences.</p>
<p>For electrical modeling, we can use the approximation that a distributed condenser (the neuronal membrane) and a discrete resistor (the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>) form an \(RC\) circuit, see also the discussion in section <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR.html#PHYSICS_MEASURING_OSCILLATOR">Electric oscillator</a>. It is clear that all currents (including the synaptic currents, the membrane's rush-in current, and the artificial currents either patching them directly to the membrane or clamping them to its axons) flow into the condenser (and cause potential increases calculated using membrane's capacitance). Furthermore, the potential drops only due to the current flowing through the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. It is the exact equivalent of <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/rc/rc-differentiator.html">a passive RC <b>differentiator</b> circuit</a>, and not to be mismatched with <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/rc/rc-integrator.html">a passive RC <b>integrator</b> circuit</a> where "the input is connected to a resistance while the output voltage is taken from across a capacitor".</p>
<p>The momentary currents of the circuit on the input and output sides are different: the difference is stored in the form of <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SLOW__CURRENT.html#PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT">slowly moving current</a>. The <em>output voltage</em> is formed by working with <em>the time derivative of the input voltage</em> instead of <em>the current shared by the resistor and capacitor</em> as assumed by HH. The <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SPEEDS.html#PHYSICS_SPEEDS_FINITE">finite speed</a> modifies the interpretation of the conservation laws. The charge conservation (expressed by Kichoff's Laws) remains valid, but only in a broader sense: the interaction is obviously <em>not instant</em>. Kichoff's Laws are valid only in their differential form (aka at a given <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SPATIOTEMPORAL.html#PHYSICS_SPATIOTEMPORAL">spatiotemporal coordinate</a>) and with different initial conditions; an important consequence of the non-instant interaction speed plus the finite size distributed capacitance.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_OPERATION"></a>
Electric operation of neurons</h1>
<p>As we emphasized, we must use <em>different physical models in the different stages</em> of operation. We have changed the <em>integrator</em>-type \(RC\) circuit to <em>differentiator</em>-type one; eliminated the fake \(K^+\) current; derived the neuronal <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> from the first principles of science, in this way eliminated the empirical functions. These changes mean that <em>we need entirely new mathematical formalism</em> to discuss neuronal operations.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_INTEGRATOR"></a>
Solving the integrator-type equation</h2>
<p>As we <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR.html#PHYSICS_MEASURING_OSCILLATOR">introduced</a>, \(RC\) circuits are well-known electric elements, with established theory. Unfortunately, at their time, Hodgkin and Huxley <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a> choose the wrong type of \(RC\) circuit. Their equations and conclusion are based on the <em>integrator</em> type \(RC\) circuit. As they say 'The first step in our analysis is to <em>divide the total membrane current into a capacity current and an ionic current</em>'. Their Eq.(1) is </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} I = C_M \frac{dV}{dt}+I_i \label{eq:OutputHH} \end{equation}
</p>
<p> Those <em>currents</em> control the operation of the neuronal membrane. With slightly rearranged terms (with the goal of comparing it to our right entity in Eq.( \(\eqref{eq:OutputMembraneVoltage}\)), </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{I}{C_M} - \frac{I_i}{C_M} \label{eq:OutputHHmod} \end{equation}
</p>
<p> The basic issue with their idea that the output voltage (aka <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a>) is \(V_{OUT}=\frac{1}{RC}\int_0^t V_{IN} dt\) ( \(V_{IN}\) can be interpreted given that the two discrete elements are switched in parallel). It implies that to produce an output voltage that first rises, after peaking goes negative, then returns to zero, \(V_{IN}\) must contain a strongly negative time-depending term. To produce such a term, Hodgkin and Huxley <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a> used a circuit where the resistances/conductances change according to some <em>empirical</em> function (i.e, an admittedly ad-hoc function, without science base). In other words, some mystic power must regulate the conductance of the elements, to make them behave as we know from a subfield of science, the theory of electricity.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_DIFFERENTIATOR"></a>
Solving the differentiator-type equation</h2>
<p>In the correct <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/rc/rc-differentiator.html"><em>differentiator-type</em> \(RC\) circuit</a> we need to work with the <em>time derivatives of the input voltages the input currents cause in the membrane</em>. We need to correct HH: <em>the time derivatives instead of currents govern the action potential</em>. (BTW: this behavior explains why a large slope of the arriving spike <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_LosonczyIntegrative:2006">[38]</a> can trigger an instant spike: the large slope (much higher than a normal one) of the current induces a much higher voltage contribution around the point of arrival on the membrane, and so it alone can raise the local potential above the threshold voltage near to the junction, triggering the known mechanism.) The input voltage \(V_{IN}\) comprises different contributors, and the differentiation is linear; i.e., we shall sum up the different contributing terms linearly (compare our equation to Eq. \(\eqref{eq:OutputHHmod}\)) </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} \frac{d}{dt} V = \sum \frac{d}{dt} V_{IN} \label{eq:OutputMembraneVoltage} \end{equation}
</p>
<p> To describe the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a>, the output voltage of the \(RC\) circuit, we need to provide all contributions \(\frac{d}{dt}V\) and solve the differential equation numerically. The time derivatives of the different voltages can be calculated using different physical models, corresponding to the different <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_STAGES">stages of operation</a>. Because of the presence of slow currents, they need different travel times and the different contributions have different time courses. We assume that the membrane is equipotential, that is \(V_M(t)\) depends only on the time, so it is identical with the voltage function to \(V_{AIS}(t)\).</p>
<p>Notice also the differences, that HH's ionic current <em>decreases</em> the voltage derivative, our one <em>increases</em> it, and in their case the resistive current is the difference between the total current and the ionic current, while in our case the current that flows out through the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> equals the sum of input currents, but they have a different time course: the neuronal condenser stores some charge for a while.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_DIFFERENTIATOR_PATCHING"></a>
Patching current</h3>
<p>In the case of a constant current where \(I=\frac{dQ}{dt}\), the voltage increase \(dV\) on the capacity \(C\) of the membrane is \(\frac{dQ}{C}=\frac{I*dt}{C}\), so \(\frac{d}{dt} V=\frac{I}{C}\). The direct <em>constant</em> current input \(\frac{d}{dt} V_{PATCH}\) to the neuron cell body is a simple constant current that causes a constant membrane's voltage derivative contribution. However, the currents are not necessarily constant. If the current follows a math function, the derivative of that function should be used. One must be careful that (step-like) <em>sudden changes may produce very steep spikes</em> (see the wave forms in Fig <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR.html#RCDifferentiatorCircuit">RCDifferentiatorCircuit</a> on differentiating a square wave function). More details in section <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ARTIFICIAL.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ABSTRACT_ARTFICIAL_CONSTANT">Constant external current</a> and in Figure <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ARTIFICIAL.html#fig_ArtificialCurrent_AP">fig_ArtificialCurrent_AP</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_DIFFERENTIATOR_CLAMPING"></a>
Clamping current</h3>
<p>The current at the switch ON/OFF events behaves as a step function; that is, it produces a saturating and a discharging current, respectively. The switch-on effect is known also in technical electricity; in biology its time constant is in the order of \(1\ ms\), that is, it drastically influences the measured biological processes, see Figure <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON.html#HodgkinHuxleyStepFunction">HodgkinHuxleyStepFunction</a>. Recall that in the case of clamping, the <em>derivative</em> contains an exponential function. In the case of patching, the <em>derivative</em> should be the derivative of a (nearly) square-wave function. Given that the current is delivered through the axon, <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON.html#MODELING_SINGLE_AXON">the mechanisms of axonal charge transfer</a> must be considered.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_DIFFERENTIATOR_AIS"></a>
AIS current</h3>
<p>The <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> represents a non-distributed resistance \(R_M\), and the current flowing through it is</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} I_{AIS} = - \frac{V_M-V_{rest}}{R_M} \label{eq:I_AIS} \end{equation}
</p>
<p> (it is an outward current, so it is negative), and its time derivative is </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} \frac{d}{dt} V_{AIS}(t) = - \frac{V_M(t)-V_{rest}}{C_M R_M} \label{eq:dVdt_AIS} \end{equation}
</p>
<p>(This current was mis-identified by HH as 'leaking current': if no other current/voltage derivative is present, the membrane discharges. See also the <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__FALLACIES.html#MODELING_SINGLE_FALLACIES_ENERGY">energy consumption</a> of neurons and the brain.)</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_DIFFERENTIATOR_PSP"></a>
Synaptic and rushed-in current</h3>
<p>In the case of those currents, as we discussed in the cases of <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__MEMBRANE.html#MODELING_SINGLE_MEMBRANE_RUSHEDIN">membrane</a> and <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON.html#AXONAL_CHARGE_DELIVERY">axon</a>, a saturation-type function multiplied by a decay-type function describes the current, so the voltage derivative is </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} \frac{d}{dt}V_{M}(t)=a*exp(-a*t-b*t)-b*exp(-bt)*exp(1-exp(-a*t))\label{eq:PSPderivative} \end{equation}
</p>
<p> The same voltage derivate (with different parameters \(a\) and \(b\)) is valid for \(\frac{d}{dt}V_{SYN}(t)\) due to the membrane rush-in current (as discussed above, the voltage derivate is proportional to the current through a factor \(1/C_{M}\)). See also Figure <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#fig_PSP_Derivative">fig_PSP_Derivative</a>.</p>

<h3><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_DIFFERENTIATOR_SIMPLE"></a>
Simple delivering</h3>
<p>In the simplest case (the membrane's voltage created instantly and then no external invasion happens), the resulting voltage derivative is </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} \frac{d}{dt}V(t) = \frac{d}{dt}V_{M}(t)+\frac{d}{dt} V_{AIS}(t) \label{eq:Simple} \end{equation}
</p>
<p> Figure <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#fig_PSP_Derivative">fig_PSP_Derivative</a> shows the functional forms of the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_PSP">PSP</a> \(V_M(t)\) and its <em>voltage derivative</em> generated on the membrane \(\frac{d}{dt}V_{M}(t)\), at some reasonable parameter values \(a\) and \(b\)). (Notice that the front of an arriving spike as well as at the beginning of clamping the front is almost clearly exponential.) Notice the sudden change of the derivative after the output (spike delivery) begins: the exponential increase of \(V_M(t)\) really causes a steep change in its derivative at low time values. This case is implemented in <a class="el" href="classNeuronPhysical.html" title="Implements a general physical-type neuron.">NeuronPhysical</a>. For different values of parameters \(a\) and \(b\), a <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#MODELING_SINGLE_AP_VARIETY">variety of function shapes</a> describing Action Potentials can be created, see Figure <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#AP_Variety">AP_Variety</a>.</p>

Complex case</h3>
<p>In the most complex case, the time derivative of voltage we need to work with is </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation} \frac{d}{dt}V_{OUT}(t) = \frac{d}{dt} V_{AIS}(t) + \frac{d}{dt}V_{M}(t)+ \sum_i \frac{d}{dt} V_{SYN,i}(t)+\frac{d}{dt} V_{CLAMP}^{PATCH}(t) \label{eq:Complex } \end{equation}
</p>
<p>The first term is always present. The second term only if previously exceeding the threshold value caused by membrane's charge-up (an instant effect). The third term changes during the stages of operation, as we describe below. The last term is an "artificial" contribution (and so: it depends on experimental settings), but it is frequently used in experimental research. Notice that whether voltage or current clamping is applied, it only means what the experimenter keeps constant; it acts with its <em>voltage derivative</em>. The same holds for the mathematical form of the used current/voltage.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_STAGES"></a>
Currents in different stages</h2>
<p>The neuron's electric operation comprises several <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#MODELING_SINGLE_AP_STAGES">stages</a>, and the different physical phenomena produce different currents in those stages. The stages of neuronal operation, and the presence of slow and fast currents, furthermore the gating mechanisms significantly shade the picture.</p>
<p>As we introduced, the ion currents are 'slow' if they arrive through the axon (as <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a> measured, an apparent <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__DELAY.html#PHYSICS_MEASURING_DELAY">'delay'</a> can be observed between the voltage and the current).</p>
<p>The 'artificial' contributions \(\frac{d}{dt} V_{CLAMP}\) and \(\frac{d}{dt} V_{PATCH}\), of course, depend only on the investigators and no additional (stage-dependent) rule is followed (although the delay may apply).</p>
<p>The contribution \(\frac{d}{dt} V_{AIS}(t)\) is always on; the neuron all the time, independently from its history, operating stage and its inputs, attempts to restore its resting potential. The \( I_{AIS}\) is active all the time. However, it is <em>not</em> a "leaking current". It is proportional to the difference of the <em>membrane's potential above the resting potential</em>. In resting state, its value is zero. The mechanism in <em>resting state</em> is different. See also ee also the <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__FALLACIES.html#MODELING_SINGLE_FALLACIES_ENERGY">energy consumption</a> of neurons and the brain.</p>
<p>The contribution \(\frac{d}{dt} V_{M}(t)\), once 'DeliveringBegin' issued, will not be stopped (except 'Synchronize') until the membrane voltage drops below the threshold value. (If the <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ARTIFICIAL.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ABSTRACT_ARTIFICIAL">artificial currents</a> are too high, the stage 'Delivering' may last forever.)</p>
<p>The contributions \(\frac{d}{dt} V_{SYN,i}(t)\) are only enabled when the membrane's voltage is below the threshold level. The amplitude of the current/voltage derivative depends on the membrane's voltage. The synaptic inputs \( I_{SYN,i}\) are active only in the charge-up and 'relative refractory' period. Actually, when <em>the membrane potential is above the threshold value</em>: the ions cannot enter the intracellular space against the higher membrane potential: the 'normal' inputs can be blocked <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_DepolarizationBianchi:2012">[9]</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="MODELING_SINGLE_OSCILLATOR"></a>
The biological oscillator</h1>
<p>In the case of biology: when the the ion inflow through membrane's wall instantly stops, the capacitor membrane gets fully charged (an instant action: the rushed-in ions cause the maximum charge-up voltage). The rushed-in ions represent an intense current in direction of the intracellular space: the amount of charge on the surface increases, manifesting in an increasing membrane voltage. However, since the ion current is slow and the membrane's size is finite, the ions near to <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> start a current instantly, and the current increases until the ions from the farthest point reach <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>. That is, when the current through the wall stops, the capacitor already reached its peak voltage (is fully charged), but the ions on the surface still follow the potential gradient. The arrival of the falling edge of the input voltage time derivative's waveform (whether square-ware or other type of falling edge) causes the capacitor to reverse current's direction, that decreases membrane's voltage. Depending on the parameters of the \(RC\) circuit, <em>the reverse current direction can result in a negative voltage on the membrane</em>, and the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> forwards that voltage through its ion channels toward the axon. In other words: the falling edge decreases the amount of charge stored on the surface of the membrane, manifesting in a decreasing membrane voltage, and finally results in a 'hyperpolarized' state.</p>
<p>As we see, there is a rather complete analogy with the case of <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR.html#PHYSICS_MEASURING_OSCILLATOR">electric oscillator</a>. In that abstraction, the charge is stored on the plates of the condenser and an infinitely fast electron current keeps balance between the charges on the two plates. In the biological oscillator it is only half of the truth. When charging up, the ion channels behave as an ideal wiring, and enable to create an ion-rich layer on the intracellular side and an ion-poor layer on the other. However, when discharging, the charge flows out through the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>'s region on the intracellular side, and it can reach the ion-poor layer only through the extracellular side. Until that time, it is "stored".</p>
<p>The effect of the finite-speed ions transferred on the finite-size surface of the membrane needs to revisit Kirchoff's Junction Law for biology, in line with the theoretical conclusion of <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__SPEEDS.html#PHYSICS_SPEEDS_FINITE">finite speed interaction</a>. If we shift the output current measured after the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> with an 'operating delay' and subtract it from the input current due to the rushed-in ions, we receive the 'ghost image' shown in <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#fig_The-ghost-image_AP">fig_The-ghost-image_AP</a> (see also Fig. 18 in <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a>). We used the function form displayed in Fig. <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AXON.html#fig_Post-synaptic_potential_lin">fig_Post-synaptic_potential_lin</a>, and subtracted the inverted function with an assumed delay time \(0.49\ ms\) between input and output currents. The resulting shape is more than resemblant to an <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a>; see the comparison with the numerical solution of the differential equation \(\eqref{eq:Simple}\); showing that, basically, the observed <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> <em>is created by the time delay of slow currents</em>.</p>

<p>The shape and different parameters of <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> has been the subject of numerous studies. For example, <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_BeanActionPotential:2007">[7]</a> measured <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a>, simultaneously with its time derivative of the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_oAPTD">oAPTD</a>, for a wealth of neuron types. Those measurements provide a direct proof for the existence of the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_iAPTD">iAPTD</a> our theoretical approach introduced, see equations \(\eqref{eq:PSPderivative}\), \(\eqref{eq:Simple}\) \(\eqref{eq:pSPVoltage}\) and Fig. <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#fig_VoltageTimeDerivative">fig_VoltageTimeDerivative</a> ("</p><dl class="section copyright"><dt>Copyright</dt><dd>{2007 Nature Publishing Group}. Bean, B. P. (2007): The action potential in mammalian central neurons. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 8(6), 451–465. doi:10.1038/nrn2148".)
Our theoretically derived \ref GLOSSARY_AP "AP" and \ref GLOSSARY_iAPTD "iAPTD" are overlayed to Fig. 2d in <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_BeanActionPotential:2007">[7]</a>. See also our Figure <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ARTIFICIAL.html#fig_ArtificialCurrent_AP">fig_ArtificialCurrent_AP</a>. However, notice that the causality is reversed: the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_iAPTD">iAPTD</a> generates the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> through the \(RC\) circuit and not simply attaches the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a>. As we detailed, it is the primary reason (it is generated by a current inflow through the neuron's membrane) as we detailed above, and its time course generates <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a>. The <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_iAPTD">iAPTD</a> should be seen in front of <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>, while the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_oAPTD">oAPTD</a> was measured when the current leaves the very first segment of the axon.
