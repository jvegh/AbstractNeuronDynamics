Dynamic ion layers</h1>
<p>Semipermeable membranes, with ion channels in their walls, separating electrolyte segments with ion concentrations differing by orders of magnitude, play a special role in the neuronal electric operation. It is at least hard to interpret the operation of the individual channels without understanding their interaction with the electrolyte and the semipermeable membrane.</p>
<p>In the <em>resting state</em> (without a voltage offset around the ion channels), the ion channels keep the balance between the separated segments. The case drastically changes if an additional potential gradient appears. In that case (part of) the ion layer, formed on the membrane's surface due to the charge arrived through the ion channels, is continuously removed by the macroscopic ion current from the immediate proximity of the ion channels. The layer gets saturated at a later time and the conditions of transferring ions through the channels persist for a longer period, so they remain open; enabling a continuous ion inflow (a macroscopic current, (see the discussion about and clamping dynamic operation using <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>). The voltage-controlled ions channels open when on the lower concentration side the local voltage exceeds some threshold value. We consider the external concentration as constant: the extracellular space is infinitely large, and its concentration remains by orders of magnitude higher than the internal one.</p>
<p>However, when an ion channel is open (meaning that ions from the high concentration side can pass through them to the low concentration side), for a short period, the ions change the <em>local</em> concentration and potential of the electrolyte in the layers in the proximity of the entrance and exit of the channels. The repulsion and attraction forces on the two surfaces of the membrane around the channel's exit act as an additional valve on the ion transport: the population of ion channels must cooperate with them, given that the ions move 'downhill'. The ion channels have three states, but their population has only two. Fundamentally, the lack or presence of ions in the proximal layers, defines the 'open' and 'closed' states of the channel population.</p>
<p>The individual ion channels open and close in a stochastic way. In a statistical sense, part of the ion channels can be open, another part can be closed or inactivated. However, only when the layer's potential enables, can the ions in the proximal layer escape to the other side of the membrane, even if the channel is open. In the lack of that offset voltage (and that layer), the ion channels have no more reason to re-open. That is, primarily the presence of the layers on the two sides of the membrane defines the ion inflow, and the individual ion channels can freely (re)open, close of inactivate until the layer provides a sufficiently large potential offset. This transient state is the key to understanding the dynamic operation of neurons.</p>
<p>There is a strong electric field on the boundary of the segments. As <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MolecularBiology:2002">[2]</a> discusses, 'an electrical potential difference about \(50â€“100 mV\) ... exists across a plasma membrane only about \(5\ nm\) thick, so that the resulting voltage gradient is about \(100,000\ V/cm\)'. In their 'off' state the voltage-controlled ion channels are mechanically closed, so the ions cannot follow that gradient. However, when (due to the collected synaptic charge or the large slope of the arriving spike <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_LosonczyIntegrative:2006">[38]</a> or clamping) a voltage offset appears at the ion channel, it opens, ions rush in from the extracellular segment into the intracellular one due to the huge gradient. (This means a high speed, that is, a 'fast' current, Stokes Law.)</p>
<p>However, upon arriving at the other side of the membrane, they experience that the electric field disappears, so the stream of ions stalls. The stalled ions increase the local potential (see section <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ELECTRIC_DIFFERENTIATOR">Solving the differentiator-type equation</a>) around the exit of the channel and the ions will move along the parallel potential gradient, toward neighboring channel exits. The received potential increase opens that channel, too, so the the potential increase quickly escalades (in an avalanche-like way <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_NeuronalAvalanches:2003">[8]</a>) to the entire surface of the membrane. This process creates an ion-rich layer in the proximity of the membrane on the intracellular side and leaves behind an ion-poor layer on the opposite side. At the end of the process, the potential in the layer on the intracellular side temporarily reaches the potential inside the bulk of the extracellular side. The ions in the layer experience two forces: in the direction parallel to the membrane's surface the electric repulsion due to the fellow ions in the same layer and in the perpendicular direction the attraction of the ions in the opposite layer.</p>
<p>The first force acts in distributing the potential uniformly over the surface, and <em>in this way (per definitionem) an ion current flows in parallel with the surface</em>. This ion current is slow: the ions are moving in a viscous solution under the effect of a potential gradient (see Stokes Law), if any. In the lack of external potential, it is of type relaxation. In the presence of a current drain (such as <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a> on the membrane or the axonal arbor on the axon), a potential difference is present and an exponential discharge function of type \(exp(-\beta *t)\) describes that current, where \(\beta\) is a time constant.</p>
<p>The second one acts against the diffusion and prevents the ions to leave the layer. In this way the membrane will "store" the ions in a condenser-like way. Until that current stops (due to the saturation of the layer), <em>an ion current will flow in the direction perpendicular to the surface</em>. That current is "fast" only within the ion channel until the driving force disappears, and becomes "slow" in the electrolyte layer, where the received charge saturates the layer. A current of form \((1-exp(-\alpha *t))\) can describe the saturation, where \(\alpha\) is a time constant. Recall that the current's speed depends on the voltage gradient, so the intensity and the temporal behavior of the currents are different, even between the "parallel" and "perpendicular" current directions, given that two different mechanisms control the process, although the motion of the same charged particles is considered. As the result of the two processes, the charge distribution can be described by a function of type \((1-exp(-\alpha *t))*exp(-\beta *t)\). Although the timing constants change as the potential changes, we use the approximation that the layer is thin, furthermore, that its concentration and potential has zero gradient in direction perpendicular to the membrane, but there exists a steep potential gradient between the layer and the rest of the segment.</p>
<p>The 'caps' on the top of the ion channels act as individual regulators, and the ion channels continuously and randomly, open, close and inactivate. Their statistical population enables a macroscopic ion inflow throughout the surface and the electric repulsion distributes the charge over the surface, tending to make the local potential uniform over the voltage. The ion layer with that potential acts as an additional valve on the ion transmission across the segments.</p>
<p>This behavior explains why ion currents across the membrane start up with a sharp exponential rise <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_SodiumCurrentDelay:2006">[5]</a> (one of the big mistakes was fitting polynomial lines <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HodgkinHuxley:1952">[27]</a> to those critical regions, comprising both exponential and no-current regions: it hides the sudden change of membrane's current <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_SodiumCurrentDelay:2006">[5]</a> caused by the state change of the ion channels); why initiating an <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> has precise timings (both the charge-up signal and pressing ions through the <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AIS">AIS</a>); why axonal arbors can provide a precise `&lsquo;Begin Computing&rsquo;' signal. Measuring the conductance of ion channels, requires special care. As discussed in section on <a class="el" href="group__MEASURING__CONDUCTANCE.html#MEASURING_CONDUCTANCE">measuring conductance</a>, it is easy to make a systematic error, given that the measurement can affect the result.</p>
<p>It is hard to separate the operation of the individual channels from the operation of their population in the walls of membranes (layers), see also axon and neuronal membrane. When the ions pass the channel, they face two effects on the two sides of the membrane. On the side of departure with high concentration, they suddenly `&lsquo;empty&rsquo;' the thin layer in the immediate proximity of the membrane. On the side of arrival with low concentration, again, the arrived ions suddenly form a `&lsquo;filled&rsquo;' thin layer. The ions in both segments can move only with their corresponding diffusion speed (in the order of \(10^{-4}\ m/s\)) but they experience each other's electric repulsion that can speed up their speed to the range \(1\ m/s\). (BTW: this effect can be misinterpreted as sudden ion adsorption <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Hodgkin-HuxleyAdsorption:2021">[26]</a> on the surface of the membrane.) The final effect resembles an electric condenser: for a short time, ion-rich and ion-poor layers are formed on the two sides of the semipermeable isolator membrane. The two layers attract each other, so the ions in the layers can diffuse toward their respective neighboring layers only moderately.</p>
