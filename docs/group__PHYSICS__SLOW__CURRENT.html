<h1><a class="anchor" id="PHYSICS_SLOW_CURRENT"></a>
Currents with different speed</h1>
<p>In some cases, when precisely measuring the time course of current compared to the time course of voltage, one can experience a 'phase delay' between them. Given that we are convinced that the charge conserves (does not appear/disappear) and the abstractions 'current' and 'voltage' are secondary abstractions and the manifestations of the primary abstraction 'charge', the experience inspired further research, that led to inventing 'inductive', 'capacitive' and 'resistive' currents. Science can describe how those currents generate each other. In biology, similar delays are experienced, but the 'phase delays' have been attributed to the media (membrane conductivity), without providing a clear reason how the <em>same charge</em> can produce its two different manifestations at a different time. Biology did not give an explanation (similar to the Mawell equations); instead, it claims that the living matter has a 'non-ohmic' behavior, and that it cannot be described by the Laws of physics. Including that some mystic power, for an unknown reason, changes the conductivity (meaning that charge can disappear/reappear; defying the law of charge conservation). However, it was not the case: in the living matter further interactions and their mixing speeds must be considered.</p>
<p>If we trigger at the same time two effects that propagate from one point to another, and they arrive at the target at different times, it may have different reasons. We may hypothesize that the triggering of one of them was delayed, or that their speed was different or that they took a break during their journey. Biology (without explaining or reasoning) assumes some 'delayed rectifier current' and refuses the other two reasons.</p>
<p>As we discussed, there is a vastly different range of interaction speeds in science and during the electric processes in biological tissues, <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ION__CHANNEL.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ION_CHANNEL">the charges may change their speeds</a> when they pass from one biological object to another one. When sticking to mathematical formulas derived for pair-wise single speed interactions in homogeneous isotrop media in classic science, we miss the possibility to describe the true nature. The formulas representing a good <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__ABSTRACTION.html#PHYSICS_ABSTRACTIONS">approximation for one abstraction</a> are not necessarily valid for another approximation. The abstraction 'metals' differ sufficiently from the abstraction 'biological tissues and cells', so we cannot hope that the notions, abstractions, approximations and laws describing the first one can describe the second one, despite that some initial resemblance exists.</p>
<p>There may be different reasons why a <a class="el" href="group__MEASURING__CURRENT.html#MEASURING_CURRENT">current</a> appears apparently with a delay compared to the voltage, such as: the charge carriers of the current have finite speed, they are <a class="el" href="group__MEASURING__CONDUCTANCE.html#MEASURING_CONDUCTANCE">produced inside the media during the measurement</a>, or they are stored for some reason for some time and released only some time later (as the conditions within the circuit change). In a limited way, one can imitate one effect with the other. Given the lack of mathematics describing the “slow” currents, it is a common practice to imitate a neuronal circuit with a simple electric \(RC\) circuit having capacity \(C\) and resistance \(R\). Although in biology it is common to describe an 'electric equivalent' of biological circuits, among others, biological <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR.html#PHYSICS_MEASURING_OSCILLATOR">oscillators</a>, one must not forget that instead of electrical processes (driven by an ideal voltage generator) electrochemical processes happen. The parallels have severe limitations.</p>
<p>The macroscopic equivalence is implemented at microscopic levels, among others, using <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ION__CHANNEL.html#MODELING_SINGLE_ION_CHANNEL">ion channels</a> and <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__LAYERS.html#MODELING_SINGLE_LAYERS">huge electric gradients</a>. The interplay of those biological objects can enormously change the speed of ions, that is <a class="el" href="group__MEASURING__CURRENT.html#MEASURING_CURRENT">the speed of ion current</a>. Within the same phenomenon, the same charge carrier can have speeds differing by orders or magnitude.</p>
<p>From the <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__ELECTRIC.html#ABSTRACT_ELECTRIC_NEURON">structure of neuron's membrane</a> follows immediately that in the <a class="el" href="group__PHYSICS__MEASURING__OSCILLATOR.html#PHYSICS_MEASURING_OSCILLATOR">neuronal oscillator</a> the capacity \(C\) and resistance \(R\) <em>are connected serially instead of parallell</em>. We assume a discrete equipotential membrane with capacity \(C\) that leaks through a discrete resistance \(R\). This also means we cannot apply Kirchoff's <em>Junction Law</em>: the capacitive and resistive currents are not equal, because the condenser stores part of the charge that flows in through the membrane and the synapses.</p>
<p>Different damped oscillations can be produced depending on those parameters. The imitation is limited: the “rise time” gets smeared, and the output signals differ for the neural and the electric circuits. Instead of a step function, we expect for a “slow” current, we receive a smooth peak-like current time course (called a damped oscillator function). However, we can use the formalism developed for the “fast“ current. Adjusting its parameters allows the electric circuit to produce a behavior resemblant to a neuronal circuit.</p>
<p>Notice that in our imitated neuronal circuit, the peak of the “fast” current appears later. The “slow” current is seen, although the delay time is not explicitly present. If we use chained electric RC circuits, such as in the case of multi-compartment membrane models <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MathNeuroscience:2010">[20]</a>, <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MultiCompartmentNeurons:2023">[60]</a>, the second such circuit receives the output voltage of the first circuit at a later time, and so on. It is also described by a system of similar equations, but they are valid at different times. Handling the many equipotential compartments attempts to cover the fact that one imitates finite membrane size and slow currents.</p>
<p>However, <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__LAYERS.html#MODELING_SINGLE_LAYERS">in biology storing charge is implemented differently</a>. The notion of storing charge can be used only in the sense that for the time of passing a finite-size element with finite propagation speed, the charge carriers spend the corresponding time in the element. That phenomenon resembles storing the charge, and that imitation enables us to describe a behavior resemblant to that of the biological circuit. Attempting to imitate the effects of biological “slow” currents using electric parallels hides that generating an <a class="el" href="GLOSSARY.html#GLOSSARY_AP">AP</a> is their native feature. No additional currents and sophisticated control mechanisms are needed: <a class="el" href="group__MODELING__SINGLE__AP.html#MODELING_ACTION_POTENTIAL">deriving-action-potential</a> is a natural consequence of the interplay of the finite speed of the “slow” ionic current and the finite size of the neuronal membrane; furthermore, that slow currents may play a role also in cognitive functions.</p>
